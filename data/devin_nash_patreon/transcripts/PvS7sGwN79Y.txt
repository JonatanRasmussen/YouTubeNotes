hello
today i want to talk about something
that is literally amazing for anybody
that is doing anything business related
ever and that is we're going to be
talking about how to construct standard
operating procedures or workbacks or
projects basically
the kind of methodology you're thinking
behind if you want to create something
new or you want to structure something
this is executive level big idea
thinking that um i've learned over years
and years from various mentors that i'm
going to talk about today and we're
actually going to do a real sop in real
time because i'm going to be
constructing the newsletter so prepare
for a very long video but um i will kind
of front load a lot of the good
information so that if you don't want to
watch the whole thing and the creation
of it you can get everything you need to
know out of the next few minutes so
there are a couple of things that i put
into every work back and standard
operating procedure um i guess it's
important to understand like what i mean
by standard operating procedures so i'm
saying like let's say that you want to
build a new sales division
of your company or let's say that you
want to um design a new product or let's
say that you want to make 30 more money
than you made before like these are all
things that um
you would i would i would basically spec
out or i'd like on a sheet of paper so
um there's a couple of core concepts
that i'm that we're going to have in
every single sop
the first one is going to be create a
brain dump of every idea so this and
you're going to see me do this in a
minute but it just means you're going to
put down every single idea you possibly
have around this concept and that's the
first thing you're going to do the
second thing we're going to do is you're
going to start with an outcome
and this is what's called input output
thinking
which is an executive methodology that's
uh formulated in amazon
input level thinking
uh we'll talk here input level thinking
is
means um
something you can control
that leads to an output
goal so that means output level thinking
is
uh something external that's a goal
uh that you can
influence the result of
but don't totally control it's not going
to make a lot of sense until i kind of
put it into a
an example so for example if i say
something like i want to lose 10 pounds
okay in
uh 60 days
that's the output right so then the
input might be
play tennis 15 minutes or it's not
really that long 30 minutes every or
five days a week right
or change input might be
lower sugar consumption or remove sugar
right
so the first thing we're going to think
of is our output what do we want to
create what is our outcome as a result
of this project so uh there's a book
called working backwards and again this
is an amazon concept where you start
with the end in mind where you have a
outcome or goal that you want to
accomplish and then you're going to work
back to try to accomplish that via
setting up the inputs okay um so
the
first thing we're going to do um that we
understand that we're just going to kind
of create this and we're going to do a
new one
i'm creating a brand new google document
i'm gonna call this patreon newsletter
uh sop
and uh or slash workback
and then i'm gonna think so now this is
all i've never done this before right
i've not thought about this before i
don't have any notes on this so this is
all just kind of like stream of
conscious thinking and my hope is that
like you see
how i kind of think about executive
level thinking um when i start a project
like this so
um
what is my so the first thing i'm going
to do is i'm just going to start like
like dumping like thoughts about like
what do i want to do well the first
thing i'm going to do is i'm going to do
an outcome okay
so
the patreon
tier
for
uh for me
right is
that that i need to get to i think the
newsletter is in tier
2 so it's 15 a month
so
if it's 15 a month and i'm trying to 5x
the value that means that uh my
newsletter
uh provides 75 dollars of value per
month to each user okay so that also
means
that um
and then i could go like a little bit
higher level and i'll say it provides
a high value
uh insight to
the new media industry
with uh takeaways
uh
with unique takeaways
and then my other objective i think is
going to be
to create
um
or to share a thing to share high value
things i'm interested in
that multiply
uh
value or number one right
so now just gonna start dumping ideas um
bullet points on things i think are cool
these can be dumb or they can be very
high value i don't really care i'm not
making any kind of judgment call on it
um
a list of news insights
from
x period of time
let's see what else a newsletter could
be
high value analysis on x topic
right um
and then like i might just go and again
like this is going to be live so like um
what can i put in a newsletter
these are things that i think people
really underestimate where you could
just google stuff right there's so many
answers now that you could just google
stuff and then i can just contextualize
that into what i want to do
interviews with experts ask me anything
okay
tweets of the week might be a good idea
so like some kind of like uh
social media post and analysis breakdown
and commentary
right it's good so see what i just did
there was i just like kind of took
something from here and then kind of
made it into what i'm looking at
behind the scenes stuff hot takes on
news
um
press coverage or guest posts
right so that's another good idea would
be just like
inviting others to post or
put thoughts in
polls or surveys those don't really
provide a lot of value so i'm just gonna
i'm done with that and i'm gonna look at
125 awesome newsletter ideas
and this is like just a really great
concept of like pretty much if somebody
if if you're doing something in this day
and age like somebody has thought of it
so there's gonna be
options on what to do and you can just
look through
um
start conversations case studies so this
is like interesting
uh
twitch
case or or youtube case studies and
analysis so that's like fliz tweets
or stream hatchet data which is a
company i work with
um
any kind of thing like that
quick tips
so that's like
uh quick bullet point tips on business
or content creation we could do like
thoughts
um
or reviews or insights into or a
challenge
uh these both go together so i'll just
go here um challenge on
what a person should think about
in their business
right um again just like thinking of
ideas
so share an actionable idea it's kind of
another way to say what i was doing
right there
um
are you hiring create job openings so
that's a good one so opportunities for
people
right that's an easy way to provide
value
like jobs
or
uh open positions and like uh
support like other people's companies or
things like that right
great content from around the web i
really like that too
um
share social proof
what's up and uh so send a letter from a
qt member give insider stuff spotlight
someone to follow in the industry
um so spotlight successful people it's a
great idea right
share a tip of the month recommend
podcasts
that's just going to kind of go in like
the cool stuff list
share lessons you've learned
package lessons from folks in the
industry
put out mistakes you've made
historical stories
some of these are dumb ideas right like
judgment is like a really uh
judgment is kind of antithetical to
creative work i think um i don't judge
any of these ideas they're just kind of
like they work for me or they don't like
in certain circumstances they work
really well but you kind of stuck and
you're like that's stupid like and
you're gonna
um you're gonna miss the point practical
examples sub niches
series are great
news so we're starting to see a lot of
repeats
tough concepts
yeah so like how x feature on twitch
youtube really works like for example
boost streams like how does that
actually work
in written form that's like really you
can already see like you know if we even
accomplish like 10 of these like we're
already providing
the value that uh people are signed up
for on the 15 tier
taking advantage of trends
inspiring stuff
i'm just going to do that automatically
hell is what's the person doing this
monkey
distraught monkeys mourn death of
robotic monkey
that's so sad okay help people see
meaning in their work
encourage people to reflect
share memes nah i'm not nervous our
infographics are great depth of story
tell people how well they're doing
uh pick up our internal data absolutely
we've got that kind of listed already
um
share what happened in an event share
upcoming events
share quotes
that's cool so i like like uh
quote
what's a bts video oh announce a party
celebrate a mind stone
um there's a lot of like sales and like
product stuff in here like obviously i'm
not making a newsletter to monetize it
that is a very viable marketing funnel
for sure but um i'm mainly doing it as a
some like i want to provide value so i'm
not like trying to sell people things
for my newsletter i might offer like uh
if i ever do like a course or something
uh or anything like that then i might
put that in the newsletter right but
uh
i'm not really the course kind of person
if i ever did a course i'd probably give
people an option to buy it for free
post a q a i think q and a's are better
in a live streaming format
we're gonna start those two soon crap
that was cool
um so we probably have enough ideas to
go off of here i'm gonna just toss this
anymore
jesus
review books oh book recommendations
super good
and
like a what i'm reading type thing
you're really good since i'm reading a
book all the time
this is like really different okay i
guess i have to accept cookies
answer questions from people
it's really good
i think that that's um kind of lame
though i'd rather do that in video
format so it's pretty limited but we're
just going to put it down because again
we're not judging
okay
so i think i'm ready to kind of like
build the actual structure of it now
that i have this
so i kind of understand like what my
outcome is and i kind of understand
like what i'm going to do and based on
this i think um the first part of the
newsletter
should be like an introduction
so i'm going to put that in brackets
and then i think the second part of the
newsletter should be
high value news
slash insights
in industry
[Music]
and then the
third value should be
bullet points
short form
what i think is cool
um
and then
that's it so
i think that um i was really inspired by
five bullet friday which is a tim
ferriss
uh
newsletter that's like extremely
powerful now
it's just five bullets that he thinks
are cool
now um granted he's uh
that's free right so so we can't just
put five bullets in an email and be like
here we go like we can't do that gotta
do better
um
so i think here
is
at least one
high value item
per newsletter
with one to two paragraphs of commentary
so notice how like i'm getting like
pretty granular here now
whereas like
i i you you've i focused on the outcome
which is really big picture and then i'm
starting to sort of
go more and more granular until i kind
of understand exactly what i want
at least one
high-value news piece
of something that happened and what it
means
and then
i'll leave that there
um i think this is
currently reading
and then i think another
like bullet point is like maybe a
product or service
uh i think worked for me
another one here would be like
a
podcast or
high value video
i'm listening to
i'll just make these uh one of these
right
and one of these
that's
three guaranteed bullet points right
there go back and look at my ideas
um and i like
one challenge
so
something
people can do in their business
or media
to improve
and
the introduction should be um
commentary on the most high value
takeaway from the past x time since the
last newsletter
and then
i'm almost done like i i want to leave
it
because because we have to understand i
i should have added this outcome
at the beginning i knew this in my head
but i should have wrote it down for you
uh which is uh spend minimal amounts of
time constructing this newsletter
and then to get that a little bit more
objective i would probably uh not want
to spend more
than one hour per newsletter
right and and that's not that's my goal
personally because again like your
outcomes are going to be specific to
what you're trying to accomplish in my
case i don't want to put a lot of time
into this because patreon is like my
secondary thing like it's like my
business has to come first um
i have to like think about my business
first before i think about like how i'm
doing um
anything else
so
um
okay so what else do i want to do
um
i think that the other thing i want to
talk about is just failing forward where
uh this is fine like like so what this
this basic level product is better than
no product at all right right now we
have no no newsletter so a newsletter
that contains these things would be
better than no newsletter so i'm just
good launching with this so i'm good and
notice that like all like uh hopefully
you're catching like all the like little
small things that are going on here i
could spend another hour or two like
thinking about some of these things and
i i might get 10 or 20 more of the way
there but 80 of the work is done um if
not 95 of the work is done and now
everything else is going to come through
experience so if i make this newsletter
people give me feedback on it i send it
out i do it right i'm going to learn a
lot more about what i need to put in it
or what i need to take out of it so
there's the skeleton that's the
structure so now the only thing i need
to really determine is
where am i kind of getting these
resources
and i already have set that up where i
get these resources is going to be from
research from the lab right
which is uh the lab is the uh arm of the
dev and nash community that like i pay
to research things or find things or
something like that so research from the
lab is going to be one
what are we doing with these bullet
points
formatting is the enemy
okay oh my god are you kidding me
research from the lab is number one um
and then creating
a list of websites
i can look at every week
on one day
and uh and then uh during the day
uh
on my personal notes put down a cool
section
and link things based on what i'm
watching
or doing
uh so
that's a so what this is is a system
process so sometimes like when i get
involved in things like this it's like
systems building on top of systems so i
have a system where i write out a daily
note thing hell that's like a that in of
itself should be a patreon video because
it's super valuable um so i'm gonna go
write that down in this uh in the
content
idea section of that
uh
video is going to be
you're just seeing my process here
uh
on daily notes so i take daily notes and
i base it on a template
and i just put in the and so during one
of those templates just answers ask me
various questions one of the questions
is going to be
um what kind of cool stuff did you see
today and then i'll just put links in
there and then i'll go through each note
one at the end of the week and i'll just
like pull them into the newsletter the
ones i think that are absolutely the
highest value because i'm always
listening to podcasts because always
exploring new things
always hearing stuff thinking about new
news pieces and things like that
so that'll be that and then there's um
there's gonna be the cool section
there's gonna be research from the lab
there's gonna be creating websites and
that should give me enough resources to
build the skeleton of the newsletter
here and get all these things done
um
[Music]
and then from there yeah i would say
this is actually the project so now from
here um i know
uh i know what i'm gonna do so like i've
got the the patreon members i've got the
newsletter i'm basically ready to start
writing it and now i know like the basic
gamework
framework of this and i'm done with the
sop so that's the sap workback um some
other things that you might want to put
in uh that might be relevant to you so
uh
these are things that i didn't need on
this one but just things that i want to
like say that you might need uh specify
team members and their roles in
authority so in my case i i am a army of
one and then there's my lab researchers
so we don't really need to specify
anything um like there's like people
that own certain parts of it or whatever
not yet right like maybe if somebody
wants to take on the newsletter
then then that's that's the case um
but for now it's just me
uh secondly uh you you might want to
define like authority um you might want
to define like um
who's doing what uh time frames right
like if you need to uh i already know
the time frame of this is going to be in
the next couple of weeks so i don't need
to write that down but if you have a
project you might want this completed in
like what is it one month two months
three months what's it gonna be
and you should always ask yourself go
back to my question my youtube video on
questions that millionaires ask
themselves and like ask yourself how do
i attend access results so if you set a
deadline of six months you should ask
yourself how you could do that in one
month even if you can't do it in one
month like it's a it's a good idea to
kind of think about how you could how
you ought to do that in one month
so i like that too
um
my time frame is fine for what i'm doing
like my newsletter should come out in
the next couple of weeks so that i don't
need to like ask myself like what but
but i could ask myself like right like
exploring my own options like what would
happen if i did this tomorrow right what
what would it take what would it what
would need to happen
um and that's a pretty easy answer like
well i could just start writing right i
think i have enough
resources that um i could go look at the
previous notes that i have from the lab
research team that's been doing them for
the last two weeks because we already
set that up
and uh i could potentially just write
this tonight right and i could have this
right probably the only thing that's
keeping me on that one to two week time
frame is like some kind of inertia like
some kind of uh
fear of moving forward
uh because every because everything else
is done there's not really anything i've
got to wait on so
uh it's just my time so yeah actually i
should just write it tomorrow
so i'll just schedule that there see 10x
works like you just asked like so much
of life is just asking yourself
questions like why does it have to be a
week i've done that all the time in like
businesses i'm consulting for they're
like yeah so that's gonna be like it's
gonna be out in like two months why like
what like why not out next week what do
you got going you know and then half the
time they don't have an answer um but
yeah that's how to design uh newsletters
and sops workbacks uh you should do this
for any significant thing in your life
uh it can be
um any kind of personal change so like
things like losing weight or exercising
things you wouldn't expect or it could
be any kind of business change um just
create a google doc write it out you'll
feel better um
i'm gonna talk a lot more about writing
because i think that self introspective
writing is like actually my superpower
it's like something that i've like spent
a lot of time um honing years actually
written thousands of thousands of pages
on and um
it'll be so i think for another patreon
video coming up soon we'll do a talk on
like how to do daily notes and like keep
track of things uh so hopefully this is
valuable just like let me know if it was
or wasn't okay
and we'll talk again soon thanks
