all right i want to talk about discord a
little bit and why i think it is a
incredible
means of
free primary free funneling which i'm
going to explain in a follow-up video
versus prime
free funnels versus paid funnels but
i want to talk a little bit about
discord this was inspired by somebody
who came into the mastermind chat dakota
and i would give his thread a read uh if
you're in that chat because it's super
good i'm gonna pull some stuff from it
uh hello uh i did a ton of work with the
among us inner sloth uh worker team i
created five amongst discords that
matched just under eight hundred
thousand followers
uh
all in less than four days uh i
currently manage a few youtubers and
streamers and run a digital creator
studio so that's freaking cool and uh
this conversation kind of sparked a
conversation about discord and i want to
talk about why i think discord is a
really really incredible
um thing that every single business or
entrepreneur or content creator should
focus on and i'm gonna kind of explain
um the difference between free funnel
versus paid funnel so i think everybody
should have as many free funnels as you
can
free funnel kind of being like a
uh a means of marketing
where new people find you
and fi and you provide value in some way
here
so a free funnel being
like uh
is it like like youtube for example
where people are gonna find you and
you're providing a lot of value
and then a paid funnel um i think you
should have
like maybe
one paid funnel for every three free
funnels or so a paid funnel as a common
thing in marketing is somewhere where
people can pay to see more of you
and the typical roi here is 510x so
if somebody pays five dollars for the
patreon i would want them to get like
around fifty dollars of value like they
should feel like they're getting like
fifty dollars of value a month from like
paying that five dollars
so like a like a video like this one
should make
fifty dollars for them or something like
that
so free versus paid funnels um that's
like a quick explanation there we'll
talk about it more and i think that
discord is one of the best
free funnels available uh in 2021 so
previously the best
uh the best free funnel ever i think was
email and email is still enormously
powerful and underrated because
uh and it's super simple like you can
pay ten dollars a month and you can get
a mailchimp account and you can just
start collecting emails for your
business or your or consecration
whatever um even content creators or
especially content creators i think they
sleep on this the most actually uh is
like powerful email lists um i i'll use
the stock guy uh his morning call for
example i i think he's public about um
the amount that he makes off of it but
it's it's tens of thousands of dollars
is a paid newsletter um that just goes
out every morning with
some thoughts about stocks and such
things and this is pretty common in the
finance industry but and more in the
education industry like when i say
education i mean like people that sell
courses um people like me all right have
paid newsletters um i do have a paid
newsletter now i guess because of
patreon but
um they actually can be used in tons of
different ways um like for example
if you are just an entertainer and you
play video games like maybe uh like a
paid option for like your top clips or
like top um or just thoughts right like
tim ferriss has five bullet fridays
which everybody should subscribe to is a
good example of like masterful marketing
everyone should also subscribe to ramit
seti uh that's r a m t
r a m t uh s-e-h-t-i
and just to see like kind of like the
power of these paid funnels so email is
really really strong and uh it can be
used in a lot of ways to complement an
existing user base um it's also the most
powerful use of email
is
for
products so so like if you're going to
if you have 10 000 people on the email
list and you say okay i'm gonna release
a product you sequence emails like 15 to
20 emails that go out over like two
months and you start talking about that
product while providing value in another
way and then what you do is you get
people very excited for like a launch or
a drop and this is how some successful
esports teams like 100 thieves have
created like amazing marketing funnels
to like sell out their merchandise all
the time so
um the reason why i'm bringing up email
and i'm talking about it a lot is one
because i want you to pay attention to
it if you're thinking about how you
build your business but also i want to
make the analogies um
that
email has to discord and why i think
discord is a
like absolutely necessary uh thing that
you have to have immediately like this
is like one of the very few things i
would say like day one i would have a
discord
before you do anything um side note by
the way twitch is not a free funnel a
lot of people make this huge mistake
because it is technically free to stream
on twitch twitch is not a funnel because
new people will not generally not find
you through it so um discord versus
email let's go through like like why
discord i think is like so strong as a
platform uh user control and information
is the number one and this is the same
with email too it's like okay um do i
have the direct ability to access a user
or to message a user yes i do right i
have there i have i have information
i have a lot of information so one i can
see who they are i can see the mutual
service that they're in um i can pull i
can message them directly right or via a
bot i can ping them via my server
uh right always of course assuming that
notifications are on but you have to
assume that your users that are
dedicated are going to keep that on if
you don't abuse it which we'll talk
about later
and um
you can you can ping these people
directly which will always work they
can't turn that off believe me i know
from my discord server right as people
pick me all the time
and you can ping uh people by role which
you can assign them to so you could
assign everybody to a certain role like
a video game or um or like some kind of
like value add and uh this is incredibly
powerful so that brings us to the next
thing which is pings
um ad everyone is a extremely strong cta
there's nothing quite like it um
besides like the equivalent to it would
be like a highly highly engaged twitter
post where like an at everyone ping
would just
immediately call to action people live
to
a
anything you want whether that be like a
product or a service like most people
use it for like a live stream or a
youtube video or something like that
i am notoriously
[Music]
very guarded in how i ping people
because i think the power of calls to
action is is unbelievable and it's
really really easy to annundate people
with pings i think way too many people
paying too much on discord servers and
really you should only ping if you want
people if you can provide value to
people immediately with that ping and um
you should never ping for like info like
info or announcements or things like
that that just do not provide value to
people so for example like if i'm like i
like add everyone update on my life
never do that right that's not enough
value but at everyone hey i just
launched a patreon that's enough value
or hey i just had a youtube video
something you can engage with right then
so that you you you train and educate
your user base that um
those people will engage with you
directly based on like
like they understand that when you're
like they understand number one if i
turn the server off i'm losing on value
right rather than just like pointless
 like most servers and number
two
as long as i keep this on and i go check
those pings every time i see one it's
going to be something that like is a new
thing that i'm interested in because
that's why i joined in the first place
right so that's really strong um the
other thing that i think is really
powerful is topic control
so topic control means that because you
can set your s you can set your server
to a certain theme way too many people
like if you have a business they
um
they like how do i explain this so like
streamers do this where it's like okay
i'm just gonna make a
discord about streaming or about me it's
like my streamer discord right and then
like big surprise that 99 of the discord
is bad because nobody like knows what to
talk about or what to do
whereas if you make the discord a theme
which is
um
something i'm going to talk about i
think on the general youtube
i i think like
how do i explain because the theme
concept is like really complicated and
like deserves a video on its own but
basically like you should never be going
out in a in a business like if you're a
restaurant you should never just be like
you know vietnamese restaurant number
537 mexican restaurant number 545 right
you should be
a your theme should be something like we
have the absolute best burritos in
pacific northwest or we have the
absolute um
best far right you make some claim to
fame
world famous like um one of the
one of the restaurants i love in the
seattle area though i love the marketing
is called ezekiel's famous chicken
um what an awesome name that is right
it's like it it's a store that sells
fried chicken but ezekiel's fried
chicken um is an amazing name because it
uh begets something immediately like oh
it's famous there's somebody that has
made it and is famous for it because the
first like every word there it counts
accounts all power words so a lot of
people they're not focusing enough on
topic control um and their discords
might feel dead or because they don't
like have a central theme so our discord
for example uh um this discord
uh devon devon
there we go
is
that the theme of that is business
development lifestyle development
consecration right and um i actually the
the biggest the biggest vulnerability i
have is that the name of the discord is
devin's community discord it's not
really that right like i could name it
to like devon's lifestyle and business
discord i might do that later like when
i have that theme but topic control is
really important and you'll see
when i
think about like how i do discord
um
most of my discord is like
themed like thematically towards that
right so i have things like content
creation business like programming this
is like an ask ask a mentor channel
things like that esports right and then
some general channels but generally like
self-improvement right these are all
along the lines of things that i believe
in and so the discord and many many
people were tempted like oh let's add a
channel about this let's add a channel
about this game or things like that but
um your topic should be very narrow at
first like if your discord is small you
know a maximum of like two to three
topics is fine and and you should be
able to like uh
you you should personally be able to
impact all those topics yourself as well
like as an expert i think is really
important so topic control super super
cool um there's so much more to talk
about with that too uh and the theme i
want to talk about that too
so um
the way the way that dakota was talking
about this um the way that he
raised his discord server to 800 000
members um was by just like tossing
money at google ads which i want to talk
about a little bit and that's uh
so you can actually use paid advertising
models to funnel people to discords
which is like incredible and then you
can then
funnel those people out to platforms
that provide you more value such as
youtube right so it's totally viable so
if you run google ads against a youtube
video um
[Music]
there's a bunch of reasons why it it
won't do well and even if it does um
it's not like facebook where if you run
actual paid advertising towards facebook
you can actually get a really decent roi
if you run paid ads on youtube like um
youtube is so much about user engagement
that when a user like has low watch time
or low engagement in any way um if the
people that you're sending to your
videos don't really like your videos uh
they won't be successful some people
have beat the system like tai lopez for
example where he's spent quite a bit of
money on goo on um in a specific
category because he only targets
self-development
so
his um
his issue is
like
okay i'm only targeting self development
and particularly i'm only using google
ads to funnel i'm using google ads and
my youtube to funnel people in to
a course which is a 67 steps program or
whatever and that's it right so what's
funny is like the vast majority of you
running businesses or content credit or
whatever you may not be you probably
can't run google ads against your
youtube video successfully but you could
probably run google ads against your
discord and then cta those people to
your youtube video successfully
right and then so and you simultaneously
also get um
members in your discord as well as uh
um people going to your youtube and then
whatever else like right like like
having that user is like extremely
powerful i i can't think of any reason
why any business like i i don't think a
single business i can think of would not
have value by having a discord so like i
i want to i want to stress i'm not
talking to content creators here
exclusively i'm not like this is very
relevant towards any entrepreneurs or
any people that are thinking about
selling products or services having your
control of a user base is really good
and also um
the syndication from discord like
pulling people from discord to an email
list very easy uh that's something that
is extremely easy to do
um
it's it's hard the other way like
pulling people from email to discord but
i'd very much include even businesses
that are like uh
restaurants or um businesses that are
retail or things like that could benefit
a lot
so
if you wanted to do what dakota did
um and you have a theme discord which is
really important you'd have to have a
theme
i think if you uh through google ads or
bing ads or whatever at a discord that
didn't have a theme like just a stream
or discord i think you'd be unsuccessful
you load up an ad campaign for like 10
or 20 bucks in like an area
um
and then you start throwing people to
that discord and create those discords
um
uh for that theme and and uh you know if
you don't have a theme you can decide on
a theme and that's good
so i think that's all my thoughts on it
um like i just think that every business
could benefit from having a discord or
at least understanding this process so
hopefully that was valuable thanks
