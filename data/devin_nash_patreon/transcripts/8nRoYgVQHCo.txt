hello many people have asked how to take
good notes which is actually a hidden
skill taking good notes both throughout
your day and in general keeping like a
plan of what you're doing is a
underrated skill actually and when i got
asked to make this video i thought about
how useful this process is in my life
and how much i've toned it and optimized
it over the years and now i'm going to
share that process with you and
hopefully save you a lot of time so this
video is about taking notes both on a
daily basis and a
weekly basis and then i will kind of
show you like how i don't go that much
farther than that but i'm going to show
you templates and just kind of show you
like the psychology and what i worked on
so i've been taking notes daily for
years and i've used all kinds of
different ways of doing it i've done it
at different periods of my life but i
always always always take notes and
structure my day
every single day to kind of get an idea
of like what i'm doing and now i i think
i've got a pretty good process so i'm
happy to share that with you all um
today
okay so let's start with the
first concept which is called capture
so capture means you need to have a
place to store thoughts
actually if you just stop the video
right here i might and you don't do this
i might have just provided you like an
absolutely insane amount of value it is
crazy to
hold on to your thoughts in your head
and not put them somewhere this is like
pretty like particularly relevant like
if you're trying to sleep
and you
have all these thoughts in your head you
should always have a journal or
something next to your bed or your phone
where you can just take down those
thoughts there's been so many times
where i've been anxious about something
i've been worried about something and i
just so so my capture process your
capture process is just like this is
like the an easy the easiest place
possible
to store stuff
write it down right could be a journal
next to you at all times could be a
phone app and for me it's uh just email
i literally just email myself and i have
a zero inbox policy
by end of week
which means that i have to process all
of my email by the end of the week for
my work address so if i'm sending
email to myself that means i have to
address that
uh by the end of the week so that's
great because that means that i know
it's gonna get there but what i can i
cannot tell you how many hundreds
literally probably thousands of times
i've been worried about something and i
just capture means like you just have no
uh no filter if your brain
uh
thinks it's important you put it down
right it doesn't matter so it could be
work related could be personally related
there's so many times i've been stressed
about something there's so many times
that i've been um just like going crazy
about something i write it down my mind
goes okay it's in there it's it's been
written down i'll be processed later and
i stop worrying about it
one of the things i talk about a lot is
like you have to create space
for
creativity you have to create space for
being able to produce real work and to
advance your business in a way that
um you can't do if you're distracted or
if you have a ton of stuff weighing on
your mind
the best people in the world they
they they focus on the critical things
that move them forward and then they get
rid of all other things that are
unnecessary in that process um and and
capturing is is probably the first step
to doing that so you capture everything
okay
but then after you capture stuff
what happens well uh i then have a
weekly slash bi-weekly kind of um
note-taking process that i'm gonna share
with you i've used an app for years
called evernote
which i i just love
and i'm going to show you what my
template is right now
um
and this has changed so much over the
years that i could go back through
evernote and i could
show you like just how different this is
if i could find one for example
where i've done
old ones at like clg or even
um years ago
where i would do
different like literally just completely
different templates i think i've
archived most of them now
so
um it's just crazy how different
it has been i've gone through hundreds
and hundreds of iterations of this
here's one from like
2018.
just to give you an idea of like
how different it was
and why i it'll give you a good contrast
so this is like 2018 let me like make
sure there's nothing like crazy in here
i don't even know what i was on
so
it's just like random ideas i think
i was still creating content or
something
and you can see like there's like i i
got down to like three tasks or
something
right
and um here's another one i tried
where
i was asking myself critical questions
and success points right
i'll wake up i'll meditate what are
these things i have to focus on it's
like way back in the day still
broadcasting
right main focus because you're success
okay so here's where we're at now
um
and let's explain like why this makes
sense
so the first thing is the overarching
theme
and i'm gonna work on one of these
right now so that i can kind of like
show you
how i would do this
so the overarching theme is going to be
what you want to accomplish for this
period you're going to you're going to
date this
on top here so for example right now
it's 8 29 so 9 1
um to maybe 9 7 or 9 14. it'd be like a
two week or one week period i usually
make these every two weeks
and then the overarching theme it might
be something like for this week for me
i'm working on stepping up my training
schedule so i'm moving hot yoga from
three times a week to five times a week
and i
am
putting an enormous amount of time into
using google calendar better so that's
my overarching theme to improve
something every one or two weeks that's
not always work related sometimes it's
personal
um sometimes it's like some other kind
of project oriented so this just be like
a summary maybe a one to two sentence
effort on
what is going on and what i want to
accomplish which is great um i think
that that is
set you'll notice that i don't really
work in long time frames
i have an idea of what i want to
accomplish
in in in multi-year
stints like um
selling a company for 50 million or
whatever they're very vague
generally speaking like i don't a lot of
people they put a lot of importance into
like year-long goals but i find that
those are so vague and so
tangential that they they don't they
don't like actually impact your daily
life you have to remember that like in
in the present moment this is all you
have right your your past you isn't you
anymore and your future you is yet to be
determined so your your present you is
the only thing that can accomplish
anything um your future you can't
accomplish anything you don't know where
you'll be or what you'll be or anything
so the only thing to rely on is like
what you kind of do on a daily basis and
that's why i put a lot of importance
into
the present time i don't put almost any
importance on like monthly goals or or
six month or 12 month goals i find that
very few people actually accomplish them
so um
mostly always like daily and weekly
goals so okay so absolutely critical and
urgent is pretty straightforward um for
me on this one i'm just looking at my
the one i updated for for september
um
i decided to do a reddit ban so i'm
going to completely ban myself from
reddit
with no exceptions except for inbound
links so so i mean no exceptions when i
say like i'm just not going to go to the
website unless i'm linked there and
that's it and and then from there i'll
check out the link and i'll leave
just i i've made that that's a critical
um
thing because i've looked at the amount
of time that i've spent on it just not
happy with it i'm not happy with like my
relationship with the website so i'm
just not going and that's like one of
the things i put there
i also did an 80 20 analysis this week
to kind of like figure out where my time
is going um so i put a link to that
and then also in this place is what
should i be doing while i'm on the
computer and i can actually like
um
i can't scroll this actually there's
this novo information in it but
basically it goes it comes down to like
scripting your ideas for content um it
comes to talking to creators or deal
flow sales or outbound right um uh
filming editing meeting with people
calendar organizing email or work or
learning uh so there's that kind of
stuff there the stuff that i absolutely
critically need to know and then this
would be for your business the top nova
projects you just write here and uh
basic summary of what you want to
complete and the steps to completing it
as pos the micro steps everything should
go by like your major project which
describes what you're doing and then
your micro steps which describe
as specifically as possible what you
need to do to try to accomplish that
content projects um this links to
another file that i have that's just
basically a dump of ideas for patreon
and for um youtube and i just put them
there
personal and jasmine projects to jasmine
is my esso um
so i always have something
for her in here
um i should start with personal i guess
so personal is going to be stuff like um
health oriented maybe it's blood tests
maybe it's certain supplements i want to
take maybe it's changes i want to make
to my workouts maybe it's meditation
it's something that is going to like i i
need to focus on my sleep schedule i
mean you're always going to have
something right nutrition there's
something that you can look at and you
can do the introspection and figure out
what you need to do the um and actually
in in the i would separate these two
um i don't i don't think it's good to
have and in here so actually in this
nine see i'm still making iterations in
the um 9-1 version of this i actually
have this separated separated so i'll
update my template
so this one is top personal projects
just because um i'm not my relationship
uh
okay and then
uh top personal projects yep just
explain that so jasmine projects is
gonna be just like what are you doing
for your so if you're in a long-term
relationship or you are
um
you have a girlfriend or boyfriend or
whatever
this is a good thing to have
you always want to be doing something
consciously to
improve that relationship if not
to fix an existing problem
um you want to be like thinking about
something that would that would forward
that especially if you're me and you
work as much as i do so i i have to
be very active in my thinking about my
relationships because
well i think it's true for everybody but
relationships do not happen
automatically like you don't build a
successful relationship automatically
you build it through a lot of deliberate
work like everything else
okay then other thoughts and notes this
is where
the raw dump of ideas and notes and
whatever goes at the end of the week
from the original process of capturing
that i told you about
the capturing so all those emails get
archived and then filtered into here
some of them get archived and they're
never important right i just organized
them at the end of the week and they're
never important others do get here and
the ones that are the most important get
filtered up into these projects so this
is the process okay i've captured it and
then i'm going to go through and i'm
going to post it all here i'm just going
to dump everything here and then i'm
going to say okay what of these projects
is important enough to get up here so
sometimes i will have an idea like
um okay we need to do xyz for the sales
process at no vote it's really important
and i'll put it down so maybe the next
day i'll go back into my email i'll find
that again and then i'll post it here
and then it will go up into a nova
project and just like that it's
something i can complete so i am holding
on to those ideas but i'm batching the
decision-making process for later i'm
saying okay i'm not going to worry about
um making the decision of whether that's
important or not right now when i have
the idea you get that idea anytime
you're in the shower get it like while
you're out with your wife get it anytime
right
but like you don't want to bash that
decision making or make a hundred
different decisions differently all over
that period of time you're going to be
exhausted you want to make all those
decisions in one batch and say is this
important is this not and move it up so
when i check my email i will say okay
that is an important decision or that is
not an important decision that is an
important piece of content that i want
to create or that is not an important
piece of content that's an important
personal thought that i want to actually
put i really should do 50 push-ups a day
um i'll put it in and i will schedule it
into this process okay and the best of
these projects will get completed and
carried over and the worst will get
dropped and that's it
so i'll put some other things in here
too
basically anything that i want to
keep myself reminded of so i have a um
like i'll i'll give you an example
of uh of of this guy
um
this is like one of my projects for um
for health related stuff so it just says
you know i want to get to four times
yoga per week two times heavy strength
training um or and one run
so that's like for workouts
um and you'll see how objective that is
right like it tells you exactly what you
need to do
but i also have stuff that's like more
spiritual so this one is like um
[Music]
i can't show you so much this stuff
because there's so much like
information in here
um
so this one like is just talking about
limiting complaining and profession and
like and improving on professionalism so
there's a lot of like other stuff like
that too
okay and then lastly i um have a daily
process right which is not as dramatic
as this so this is the this is the the
weekly process but the most important
thing to understand about this is you
understand the flow you capture via
email you put it here and then you put
it into your projects you may have a
different way of doing this obviously
you're gonna experiment but this works
works really well okay then i have my
daily
right um daily process what do i
accomplish in the day and this is it by
the way i do i do
one
yearly goal setting
paper
at the beginning of the year in january
and then i never look at it again i
probably should look at it again that is
literally the only long-term planning i
do
i will look at it now
do i even have one did i even write one
for 22 oh i did
yeah
so it looks like
um
i have like a professional goal at novo
a professional brand goal
which is 300 000 subs on youtube should
be higher
and uh twitter 60k
and then a bunch of health goals
yeah i've never looked at these since i
did them in january five million
uh an extra revenue
in the company okay cool so some
relationship goals great that's all i do
on a yearly basis everything i might not
even do it next year it doesn't
move the needle at all i'm so much more
successful if i'm just doing it this way
on a weekly basis daily basis okay so
daily process
daily process is going to be super
simple guess what i use notepad
big surprise
and then i ask myself the question two
questions what if i had one hour to work
today what would i do
and what are the two things i can do to
move
the company or my goals forward
more than anything else
and then really simply i do it to do
right to do 8 29 2022.
number one number two number three and
that's it i'm gonna do them
and then i delete that or i archive it
into the main um bi-weekly notes that we
just went over and that's it that's all
i do
just make a quick to-do list at the
beginning of the day or the end of the
day and i just do it and i ask myself
these two questions and these two
questions guide me along with the
projects that i need to work on here
on what is the most important stuff to
get done
um because
the what you'll find is i don't know if
you're in this position yet but you soon
will be if you're focusing on stuff like
this you will
always be busier particularly if you're
like a small business owner or you own
your own thing there will always be work
to do the most important thing to do is
to organize your work in such a way that
you are getting rid of the things that
are pretending to be urgent but are not
actually important
and you are instead focusing on things
that are important that could be urgent
but also could not be urgent they could
be things that are actually really
important to do that um
that that you might not see are is
actually important to do most of you are
wasting time an incredible amount
probably like i'd say north of 100 hours
a week
um sorry 100 sorry i do things a two
week period so 100 hours every two weeks
three to 36 hours in um two weeks and so
you probably waste over 100 hours which
is two full-time jobs
in
uh everything right now some of that's
acceptable like um
you know gaming or um
or or like whatever you enjoy
but there's actually an incredible
amount of time in in a week like uh like
an amount that would probably surprise
you um so like i said
let's see just so i get this right
how many hours
in a week okay so there's 168 so 168
times 2
yeah 336 like i said before yeah so
there's 336 shouldn't second guess
myself there's 336 hours in a week right
and you're gonna sleep roughly in two
weeks um
you're gonna sleep roughly 30 of that so
your sleep is gonna be
uh assuming you're sleeping about seven
hours a day which is like kind of dead
average that's 98 hours
and
then you know you're eating and like
you're like self-care and everything
showers stuff like that let's call that
like three hours a day that's 12.5 or 42
hours of your time okay so that leaves
you 112 hours
and then 84 hours right so so you get a
total of um
let's see
112 plus 84. so 196 hours to basically
do whatever the hell you want which is a
 load of time assuming you'll have a
job right but even if you do have a job
like it's 40 hours commute you still
have that time
so if you look at the life in that way
and you look at your scheduling that way
you start to realize that you can like
basically accomplish anything
um
that you'd want to
if you kind of just like set your mind
to like doing it right and then
what this should do is it should make
you very aware of like the time vampires
you have that are they're draining that
time away from you because
um for example like there
there are many weeks where i spend 30
percent of my time or
105 hours
gaming like just playing games that's
two full-time jobs right like i could
start a whole another business
on the side doing that and and the
perception of a lot of people is that i
work a lot right another way to put that
is i could work 80 hours and i could
still maintain 30 of my time gaming
right if i was hyper efficient
so so which is what i do
so so um that's crazy right because like
like that um that says that's why i i
told you the 112 number
was 33 of my time last week was gaming
but 84 hours was working so i still
worked at enormous amount of time
my my split for the last two weeks was
29.16 sleep 12.5 eating and exercise uh
33 gaming uh 80 and then 84 hours of
work
so uh which is roughly 30 of my time as
well
so so i i still worked you know 45 hours
each week and uh in addition to doing
like way too much gaming because path of
exile came out and normally i don't game
that hard
but it gives you an example of like you
can still become like super super
focused and like
if you're optimizing your time in the
right way
and by the way like i want to talk
something about that 45 hours
that i spent
that was on really good stuff to do um
like if you look at like what i
accomplished in like the last week right
like i had um
i had i had a number one performing
video i think it's like north of like 20
000 views
um i had uh
let's see like like a thread on twitter
with like over 800 retweets i had a um
nova nexus like surpassed like a
thousand creators
um which is our like our system for
bringing creative sponsorships so so
like a lot happened right and like we
had a successful merch drop that was
another thing i did like like with quinn
um where we sold out in two minutes so
so like there's a lot that happened
right there's like a lot of like really
critical stuff in just that two-week
period and that should be pretty normal
you should be having those like
milestones and those breakthroughs like
all the time the the the problem is that
like most people are um
i'm not sure if i like have a weird way
to like communicate this like most
people are just like not doing things
that are important
like like or or their sense of
priorities is wrong and like i'm not
exactly sure how to teach this yet
so like for example um a lot of people
think that like in the content creation
world that the process of
uh
creating great content is just live
streaming which is like completely wrong
like you should be live streaming as
little as possible you should be
thinking about your ideas and like the
content you're making a lot of people
think that the best thing you can spend
your time in on youtube for example is
um
is video production like like editing
it's not it's like like a better edited
video doesn't necessarily convert to
more views unless you're thinking about
your audience in that way but like
thinking about your ideas thinking about
your thumbnails thinking about your
titling thinking about your like the
structure of your video is way more
important than any kind of like
production editing
um likewise like most people in their
business are like focusing on working in
the business like if they're an
electrician they're um just fixing
houses and stuff they're generating cash
flow which is great but like you should
be thinking about like how to like 15x
that either through like upsells or like
through um
uh like more employees or like any
number of things like there's always
those kind of critical force multipliers
and you should go ask yourself you
should go watch my video um
questions millionaires ask themselves i
think it's one of the most important
videos i've ever done on the public
youtube channel to kind of get an idea
of more of that okay so this is my this
is it uh daily process uh two week
process
and then capture i think hopefully can
help you out a lot let me know if it
does that's it see you next time bye
