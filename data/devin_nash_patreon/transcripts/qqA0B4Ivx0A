okay i want to talk about opportunity
cost and time value of money
so
every single person has a monetary value
attached to them don't worry that's not
your real value your real value is
incalculable because you are a unique
being
a being born
of possible trillions and trillions of
combinations you are the one that came
to be
so don't sweat it you're priceless
but in the state of america
and uh other places in the world you
have a value and that value is at a
minimum
uh the federal minimum wage right which
is
seven dollars
and 25 cents yeah
as of right now
so
that means that for what you are doing
with your time you can go do something
and make seven dollars get a
minimum right doing something that
you'll probably get more um you know
like at least like ten dollars something
like that but let's assume that you have
absolutely zero skills you live in a
super super bad place and that is your
expected um
rate of return for any investment of
time that you put into a job or work and
you get seven dollars back okay well
that's not that bad because there are a
bazillion different things you're doing
with your time that gets you zero
dollars in return right
so if you want to
build wealth
build
opportunity
or make more money
uh that's what this talk is about a
little bit
we're gonna jump around so
if you want to accomplish these things
you have to
trade
time
for
money right
or build systems that create money with
pre-invested time
and what an opportunity cost is
an opportunity cost is
the
price of choosing one option
against another
so
if you choose to watch netflix for two
hours instead of watching
uh instead of working at subway for
seven dollars
then your opportunity cost of watching
netflix was
14
because you could have made 14 doing
that does that make sense you watch
netflix
for two hours or
work at seven dollars now i don't want
to use 25 cents this is too complicated
14
opportunity cost okay
but
it gets so so where this i'm now we're
going to start getting interesting okay
so if your opportunity cost let's say
that you could you could you could earn
50 an hour
and
for what it is worth i am fairly
convinced that 90
plus of the people that are watching
this video could reasonably earn 50 an
hour
anybody with a college education or
any sort of set of skills whatsoever
could probably apply a lot of the job
building and earning
techniques
that um we cover in various videos
and
uh by doing so could earn
um
vastly more than
seven dollars an hour okay sorry got
distracted there so opportunity cost is
the price of choosing one option against
another and then so um one of the things
that people think is that they always
seem very behind in their wealth
generation or their money generation but
that is because they are taking
most people
are taking opportunity costs that not
only
grow
not only
don't grow
themselves
or their worth
but also
subtract from it
uh and they do this continuously
so for example
you spend eight hours
out in the city
you buy dinner that's like fifty dollars
uh go somewhere activity that's like
fifty dollars
um
you know uber around it's like thirty
dollars
yeah yours your cost is
130 dollars
plus actually costs like a lot more to
go out in the city but there you go
but you've also lost eight hours so
minus eight hours of time
right
and let's say that your time is worth
fifty dollars an hour well you've lost
another four hundred dollars
for a total of
five hundred and thirty dollars lost
and in this way people get behind
um because most people don't spend their
time
growing their wealth in a
discernible way so what do i mean by
that well let's take the previous
example where if you are worth seven
dollars an hour and you you could have
watched netflix for two hours what if
you spent that two hours
learning a skill
that could increase
the total value of your time
and this is a concept that i think a lot
of people don't realize that they can do
is you can essentially infinitely
elevate your
um your the value of your of your of
your time
by learning skills and becoming better
at them so if you become a master of
something you can charge a great deal of
time for something so for example i
would probably not
pay that much to a kid who's learning
tai chi
for six months to instruct me but i
would certainly invite to my house the
grand master that has been doing it for
10 000 hours and knows exactly what to
do right and that person because of that
demand could charge for that time so
when i s but the first real consulting
that i ever did i charged 50 an hour uh
that was for computer repair so i would
like consult on how to build better um
how to be better at computers back when
this was like more relevant especially
for older people
and
the uh the 50 rate was just like what i
would charge and i would upsell some
like security software and stuff like
that you know whatever checkups things
like that so 50 an hour was my time and
that was because i had an expertise that
most people did not have so why i think
that people could start at 50 an hour a
lot of people might not think that they
can do that but it's because
i mean most people are reasonably
well-versed with computers or could do
some kind of service or or like some
kind like rover or or like driving where
you could you could get to around these
rates
and um if you have any kind of expertise
in something where you can teach or you
can guide somebody then you can probably
get 50 so i started there and then over
time i rose my
value to
what is currently 500 an hour which is
what i charge for consulting uh and i
have so much consulting i don't know
what to do with it there's there's so
many clients the reason i can charge 500
an hour um is because i'm 100 confident
that i will provide more value than 500
now a lot more value if i if i get into
it and attached to that consulting is
all kinds of like um
connections or potential suggestions or
like actionable stuff that comes with it
many like corporate consultants like
come in just talk for an hour and leave
like you actually get all kinds of like
uh actionable stuff like google docs and
things like that uh talking to me so i
know i provide that value the reason i
don't go higher than that though is that
i don't think that the value beyond that
point is like exponential so if i charge
like a thousand dollars an hour like i'm
not yet at the expertise that i
want to
that i think i can do that some people
might disagree but i think that's true
so
um that's an internal evaluation that
i've done but the point is that the
reason why that came to be was because i
spent
many thousands of hours
learning business
content creation and marketing
and how to get attention
and how to monetize it
uh which is a skill that a lot of people
care about it turns out so um they'll
pay me for it right so you in the exact
same way
um
have to start thinking and i'm about to
doom you maybe a little bit because this
is kind of a crazy way to think but
every single
hour that you spend doing something
against
uh like building value in yourself or
actually working
is an hour that has lost opportunity
cost so in a way this is a curse because
once you understand this you'll feel
guilty about any time that you spend
doing anything else besides something
productive
but
when you actually
[Music]
when you actually arrive at like the
final version of this thought you'll
realize that
it's actually one of the most freeing
things ever because even whether you
charge a very high or low rate when you
consciously surrender the monetary gain
or or you know intellectual gain or
whatever you get from
working or
building yourself
you consciously surrender that to an
activity that you really want to do
that's an awesome feeling so if i take
you know two to five hours to hang out
with my family
that i
really want to do
that opportunity cost might be in the
thousands of dollars had i applied that
across to working more but
it's that much more valuable because
i've i i've consciously decided to
invest that time
so many people um
therein that have this mindset are left
with two choices you can work more
right and increase
your
wealth relative
to your current
value or you could learn more
and increase your value relative to your
time
and i like number two a lot more because
it feeds into number one and working
more is what the vast majority of people
will do but if you're working more and
you don't have an expectation of
increasing your rate unless you're happy
with where you're at like for example i
don't i i can i don't really have an
expectation of increasing my consulting
rate it's fine like i it's where it
needs to be it provides a ton of value
for its v for its for its value and
that's all there is to it everyone
that's paid for it has loved it and
there's no there's no like real problem
there's not too high doesn't make people
feel like they're um getting screwed and
i could charge higher but i'm not really
looking to
so
when i learn more now
i learn more for the objective of
growing equity in projects that i'm
working on for example novo right as an
agency i might be learning a business
leadership tactic or taking a mentorship
course or um and one thing i i would say
is there are primary learning okay uh
this is something you've probably i i've
never heard talked about before
secondary learning where primary
learning is things like direct skills so
maybe it's like programming
or marketing or like anything you could
just sell to do
i mean literally anything but secondary
learning are things like tai chi
meditation yoga um
better like fitness okay and one of the
things that i think would be one of the
most valuable takeaways from this video
is that i spend at least as much on
secondary learning as i do on primary
learning and the reason for that is
because
um like what if i told you that a
regular meditation class would increase
your
total value
per hour it doesn't make sense right
like initially but when you realize that
meditation has the side benefit of
creating more time of making you more
focused of allowing you to
reduce anxiety and distractions then you
start to realize oh man meditation could
actually directly affect the amount of
money that i make
like just straight up
it does it in a secondary way but these
secondary learning skills are no less
important than primary learning skills
so
if you choose a primary learning skill
and
start to learn it you should also choose
a secondary skill and start to learn
that and you might find that your
secondary skill
is
even more beneficial to that processor
equally as so like i think that hot yoga
for me
in clg was a major qualifier for why i
was able to run that company effectively
because i had something at 6am every day
i could wake up for that challenged me
and gave me perspective so that when i
went into the business world i was that
much more effective
which i may not have been or may have
been more stressed or carried things
over from the other day like being on
that mat was a huge positive for me and
and some form of martial arts like jiu
jitsu or yoga um or tai chi has always
been a component of my life so i would
encourage you to to
not just go to primary learning as a
methodology for increasing your current
value but um many people do not even do
that so if you if all you do is learn a
primary skill at all times during your
life you should be learning one at all
times whether that be
um
a
well it should always be a primary skill
um i would encourage you to utilize what
i call net time which is no extra time
and
this alone is whatever your your pain to
be here um to listen to this and i
really appreciate that you are doing
that um hopefully this returns the value
of that as i'm always desperate to
return that value because this is one of
the coolest concepts ever no extra time
means
when can you
learn a primary or a secondary skill
in the context of something that you're
doing anyway that you can't get out of
so
can you are you do you ever walk places
and like uh are you ever wait in line
for things you have to wait in line
consistently do you have a commute
because of work can you listen to a
podcast in the car do you ever do you
shower right can you listen to your
phone
deploy your phone speakers and then
shower and listen to it
use your net time
to
start learning primary and secondary
skills i'm always listening to either a
book or
some kind of talk about marketing some
kind of talk about the industry some
kind of whatever and as much as i
possibly can i'm using no extra time to
consume things that will build and make
me learn more so like while it might
seem to other people that i have a
relatively diverse and in-depth amount
of knowledge in reality it's just
because i'm really spending a lot of
time um
all the time that i can
like following and listening to things
like for example right now just walking
to work i'm listening to an audiobook
called the untethered soul which is a
self-improvement book right
about better mindset
and um
what else am i doing um i was listening
to
in the shower i was listening to the
acquired lp podcast which is a podcast
about mergers and acquisitions and such
and then
if i'm setting something up here at like
work or something and i'm waiting for a
meeting or something for like 10 minutes
i might listen to like a marketing talk
from an executive that i find on youtube
and you put yourself in the state of
constant learning and eventually get to
the point where you realize like oh man
i actually like
know a lot more than i thought and one
of the of course the most powerful ways
to do this is to like this is more of
like a deliberate thing so going off of
no extra time but
uh is just read right just just read
more nonfiction books um read one book a
month which is
achievable for every single person
and pick up it's so easy too like a lot
of people ask me for book
recommendations i think book
recommendations are mostly obsolete
because you can just go to amazon and
search for the subject that you want and
then look at the highest reviewed book
that's the new york times bestseller for
that and you can bet that's going to
provide a lot of value
so i'll still get a lot of great
recommendations for books and at some
point for patreon i'll put up a
um i'll put up a list of books
that i that i've benefited from but yeah
in general like there's no excuse to not
learn a primary skill so if you choose a
primary skill and you choose a secondary
skill and you start doing those things
your life will immediately get better
and your time value of money will go way
up too
so eventually you'll reach a point where
you're actually pretty happy with your
time value money and you don't need to
increase it a huge amount this is
different for all kinds of people for me
it's um i feel like
there is
really no universe where i could spend
more than 250 thousand dollars a year
and
and my quality of life would improve at
all it's probably 150 000 a year that i
feel that because that's not near the
amount of expenses that i spend every
month right i probably spend around 60k
a year like 5 to 6k a little bit more
than that and i feel like i live pretty
extravagantly and i live in seattle
which is like really expensive but i
don't buy a lot of really big things and
and that's and that's my personal so i
don't need to increase my personal value
sell a bunch of products and services or
everything that
drive up my time and uh and get involved
in my life because my i'm very
comfortable with my time value of money
as i've structured it to be and you will
have your own internal barometer of what
that number is and there's no wrong
answer to that like you may end up i
know plenty of people that make 30 to
40k a year they have a ton of time and
they love their wife and they love their
their their their wife and they love
they have kids they're fine and they
don't sweat it at all like they just
they spend more time they're more
deliberate with their time i also know
people that make millions and millions
of dollars a year and they're miserable
uh every streamer at the top one percent
basically um but not just them like also
like business people or or such things i
also know people that make millions
dollars here that are that are
phenomenally happy by the way um because
they've mastered this process the point
is that like your time value of money
you just need to
set a number like i'd like to be worth x
number per hour is a great goal and then
trying to and then start working
backwards
like even even documenting this i'd even
write this
in a way that um allows you to get there
what kind of skills would i need to
learn uh over what kind of time frame to
increase my time value money where can i
start can i can i start higher than i
think i can so a lot of people can
because maybe you think you're worth 15
to 20 an hour because that's all you've
ever gotten paid but lo and behold like
you've been on a computer for a long
time you're a gamer you know how you you
know your way around you could probably
craigslist for 50 an hour right away to
just go fix people's computers at their
houses that's how i started
and um maybe you could take a sales
position because you're a more outgoing
person and more extroverted and you know
that you are a good talker and
charismatic and you can probably make
more off of commission right away right
there's a ton of different ways to
reframe your thinking to like once you
start thinking about the question how
can i increase my time value of money
then i i think you'll you'll start
reaching some really interesting
conclusions very quickly about how you
can do that
and the end result will be that
eventually you'll be at a place where
your time value of money is equating you
to your level of happiness and that will
be a really cool place to be so i
wouldn't stress about getting there
because um once you start setting these
objectives you'll be really surprised
like how fast you can get them i set up
vision boards every year where i would
just have one day i'll i'll show you
mine um but i i just have like a giant
board that i
i glue things to like pictures of things
and then i also glue goals to might say
something like uh you know i want xyz
and net worth by this amount of time and
then you you give yourself a realistic
amount of time to do it and you and you
make your expectation realistic and as
you work towards those things by
learning these skills you'd be surprised
how you can accumulate that wealth and
or that or accumulate those goals much
quicker than you might suspect
so that's opportunity cost and how to
increase your time value money the
opportunity cost thing i think everybody
should think about um
opportunity cost also what one final
note still valuable like in in the
context of business you could always be
doing something or something else so i
could be so
i i think the most effective thing you
can possibly do as a business owner
is and this is a peter drucker concept
from a book called effective executive
which is one of the best books on
management ever written and you say what
is the one
critical problem right now that if i fix
this problem no matter how uncomfortable
it is for me like will move me forward
and and and like usually that's the
problem that you want to avoid so the
problem you don't want to talk about but
if you
address that problem that's the one
that's going to actually push everything
forward i would encourage everybody to
think very carefully about that concept
and that's a question that i ask myself
when i sit down in this chair in the
office every single day what is the
number one problem that i need to
address and then you can work on that
and that is usually your highest value
for opportunity cost but um once you
understand the concept of opportunity
cost you can weigh
things against each other
just in terms of pure roi and this
doesn't just work for finances in
business but for real life as well like
okay well the opportunity the
opportunity cost of going to that party
um for some co-worker is that i don't
get to relax on my day off and chill
here with like my family well i don't
want to do that that's opportunity cost
is not worth paying so rather than feel
guilty about it you just do that roi
calculation you're better off
all right so that's time value money and
opportunity cost hope this helps
talk again soon thank you
