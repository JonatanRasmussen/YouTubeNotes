hey so today we are going to be talking
about how to get exceptional work
particularly in positions that you might
be under qualified for senior level
positions by doing unconventional
techniques and this was spawned by Colin
here in Mastermind chat who said there's
a mid to senior level position at a
startup I love their content Mission
customer success I don't really think
this is a key differentiator in where
the business is heading as to your
customer support the application process
is actually emailing the CEO of the
resume and adding some info about
yourself I was thinking about adding a
quick video to stand out what should I
include without being too long or too
cringe Okay so
uh for context there's a couple of
things that I've done in the past if you
go to YouTube and you search for Devin
Nash Ethan Evans Ethan Evans is an
Amazon
um Amazon former Amazon SVP who did a
ton of work around
um hiring and particularly these resume
these resume critiques and things like
that um which are just shows with us
like going over like resumes are so
valuable for getting jobs so just gonna
put that out there here and then I'm
gonna give some specific advice if
you're applying for a senior level
position that I have seen work for a lot
of my clients as well as just people in
general that have kind of sent me
messages and said these techniques work
um and and this will also help answer
Collins question as well so
um in a senior level position
it it it's funny because every job
um every job asks you to tell them
something about yourself but what they
really want is how you're going to solve
their problem so start with any kind of
application to a job as why is the
person or really the decision maker that
posted this position why have they done
it well they've done it to solve a
problem right so if I'm an entrepreneur
and I'm trying to hire somebody I'm
hiring somebody because I'm trying to
solve a problem within my business that
isn't solved yet so if I'm hiring a
salesperson because I don't have enough
sales right if I find a marketing person
because my marketing is bad and that may
seem really obvious when I say it like
that but if you think about how people
traditionally apply for jobs they apply
almost like
um they apply actually this is kind of
true everywhere in the world it's
interesting like I was gonna use an
analogy like they're dating but then I
realize in dating people do this as well
they talk all about themselves so when
you go up for a job you come up and you
say hey
um these are why this is why I'm
qualified for this position but that's
not what you want to do so like typical
typical goal introduction
here's a little about myself
how I started
my history and then maybe why I'm
qualified for the job
usually you've lost your recruiter in
this period of time so I'll get a lot of
CVS where people are just saying
uh I have eight years of experience in
gaming I have this and this this I just
I just don't care right because those
are not things that are actually
targeted towards solving my problem
right my problem is I want to get more
sales and I want to understand if I'm
hiring a sales person let's just say I'm
hiring a salesperson
I want to get more sales and I want to
understand how this person that I am
hiring is the absolute best at getting
me sales so how would I open up
something like that
um
I see I I so first of all Colin here has
already actually figured out
one major part of the problem which is
why are you even getting this job like
it's not for and I love that I use this
I decided to make a video about this
specifically because of the way that
Colin worded this is he's showing that
he has real passion behind why he wants
this position he he says right here like
he unironically thinks that this
business is a key differentiator um in
in the industry they're in great that's
why you want to apply for every position
right like you want to you want to be
passionate about a company that you're
joining not just because of the paycheck
and you want to apply for a scene level
position there because you can
contribute so the first thing you want
to do is actually like in Colin's cast
case he would lead with a statement like
this he's saying this to his Mastermind
chat here but in actuality he should be
saying this to the company right which
is you know you can lead with something
like
um even a story like I was uh I was just
I I I I I was like I love authenticity
these kind of things so I would start
with something like
um I'm in a mastermind chat where I
uh periodically like just try to
figure out how to level up my game
and
I asked them
how to apply for this job because I'm so
passionate
about your content your mission
and I think that you're a key
differentiator because of this reason
so that statement right there
establishes a few things
one it's highly unconventional
no one would start with like so I'm in
this Mastermind chat but you started
with a story and now I'm kind of
interested in my Mastermind what does
this have to do with anything and I'll
keep reading right instead of I have
eight years of experience in X I don't
care I have 500 500 resumes like that
that I'm reading it okay I don't care
yeah I was like I was in this Mastermind
chat I was literally trying to figure
out how I could get this job because I
am so passionate about the story of your
company specifically these things so
let's look at what that establishes you
told this story you've shown that you're
uh an a player right because you're in a
mastermind trying to learn how to be
better so that's immediately interesting
that shows me that you're it shows that
tells me a lot about you like right like
you're self-improvement oriented you're
willing to actually pay to like get
better like there's a lot in there that
is cool then you say
um
I was asking them specifically about
this company so you've taken the time to
like go to your Mastermind and ask about
this company because you're so
passionate about legitimately joining it
then you after that you say specifically
these things which shows that you've
done your research and this is why you
truly believe in the company
so you can so you can choose what kind
of medium you want to communicate that
on I think it is the medium is great
Unwritten I also think that a little
video that's like two to four minutes
max right even like a minute and a half
that's just carefully scripted you know
very personal kind of talking head type
video with not a lot of editing but you
could like splice in a couple of just
like
articles about what the company has done
that or or specific things that really
impress you
and I'd give it like a minute to a
minute and a half
and notice that this entire time you
haven't yet said anything about your own
individual qualifications you started by
telling a story
and then you start and then you
continued by saying the things that you
specifically love about the company
right and you're going to want to
continue that all the way through your
CV and if you can
I would not talk a single Iota about
yourself and that's going to be
counterintuitive because you're going to
think that hirers want to make decisions
about
how to hire somebody
based on what their experience and
qualifications are
so there is some truth to that but I
will find out all that information on
your resume if I choose to read it which
should actually be your technical
qualifications and in a lot of positions
especially creative positions now
the actual results that you've produced
don't matter as much where that matters
is things that are technical jobs or
stuff like uh sales to use that example
before I I'm really interested in how
much you closed last year but if you
have the right story
and you have identified the company
problems that I have
without me telling you and you've told
me how you're going to solve them I'll
hire you even if you've never closed a
deal in your life
and and most interviewers even at very
high tier companies feel the same
you can you can tell a little bit about
the CEO because he's asking you to
personally email him
and tell you tell something about
yourself
in addition to a resume which means that
the CEO is confident enough to lead the
hiring process themselves
and they like storytelling because
that's what they're asking for so I
think that in this case you want to
absolutely leave with a story The
Mastermind is a great story I think but
you could also lead with a personal
story of some of how you got introduced
to this company
and why it matters so much differently
and why it's so different from their
competitors
then from there identify why they're
hiring for that position and I and in
this I don't even know what the job
posting is I'm basing all this off of
just what I've read in this couple of
paragraphs that can tell you a lot right
you want to really carefully understand
that language I know it's a mid to
senior level position which means it's
probably creative
it's probably not technically oriented
so it's probably like a creative
director rule of some kind whatever that
position is being hired to do based on
that job posting try to solve that
problem with the rest of what you are
going to write and I think the physical
structure
of your um of your email
is going to be
um so if this is the email here right
the body is going to be
I'd say one to four two to four
paragraphs okay so so this is just this
is just text right
storytelling text
and then uh and a lot of people by the
way just for like a sales type of thing
the body of an email is very powerful
even if you're attaching information
and so I usually use that as a
supplement to whatever I do your resumes
here and maybe a short link to a video
attached here
and that's what I would include and the
video again we are described it is like
a minute and a minute and a half
and of course it should go without
saying that everything on your resume
should be tailored towards the position
that you are trying to get the objective
of your resume so on the top of every
resume you're going to have an objective
that states very clearly why you are
applying for this position what you want
you'll specifically call out the company
there and then you'll be very good at
follow-up so you'll start your follow-up
about three to four days after you send
the email you'll reinforce in that
follow-up email that you are super
passionate about this and really excited
to hear back and I would be uh I'd be
surprised if you did the one to three
minute video
and you didn't get the position
interviewed right you didn't get the
interview and and I think a lot of the
video taking type of thing is about
vulnerability and authenticity
so I love to start a video like that
with like hey I'm applying for this
position I'm doing this little video
because I just want to convey in a
different format how passionate I am
about this position and how I really
think I can help solve this problem
and I know it's weird and I know it's
kind of weird to get something like this
and but I'm doing it because I've got
that patch like lending into that
vulnerability in your scripting right is
very powerful
and I've seen the best results with this
technique when somebody uses a video to
sort of broadcast their authenticity
rather than just read off a script about
why they're qualified because you can do
this wrongly you can do a video the
Wrong Way the wrong way to do a video is
like
you carefully write your own
qualifications and just talk about
yourself notice that the whole theme of
getting a legit position at a company is
always talking about
the company and that is true let's go
back to like dating or sales or things
like that it's the same thing like what
human beings want to hear stories they
want to hear about themselves they want
to be asked questions they want to be
they want to feel acknowledged they want
emotion to be evoked they want to feel
like they're understood
so everything you do should be towards
those goals and many many of the best
sales teams in the world
are not allowed to actually talk about
themselves or their company isn't that
crazy so on the entire phone call they
can only reflect what a person has said
so that means like if someone has said
yeah so we have a bunch of problems with
closing right now it feels like we're
about 25 down and we just can't get our
sales people to do this a reflecting
statement would be something like so it
sounds like you're down really bad on
the on this quarter and you can't get
your people to do this right you're
literally saying the same thing they
said and that they won't notice like it
will feel like they will notice that but
try this in in conversation it's called
mirin where if somebody says something
literally just say the same thing back
to them you can do this for an hour and
nobody will know it's crazy like even
people that are really good at this
um will not know that it's happening and
and so you want to mirror reflect and
then
um the offer like only comes in at like
the very end like so what do you think
the next step should be and if they ask
you a question answer as succinctly as
possible
and answer it in a way that is trying to
address or solve their problem right
seek to understand not to be understood
so those are some of the things that I
would recommend in sort of short form
for how to apply to a job or I guess
this video kind of turned into how to
convince people of things in general
which is something I think a lot about
the other thing I would say is I would
just to kind of like close this out with
some value
I would also write about
three to five sentences out
that are sort of power sentences that
you can anchor on if you're lost that
will add some passion or something back
into the conversation
so for example if I'm on a sales call or
I'm in an interview
um something I might I might have a
quick story
that reminds me of this time when I was
at this company and this happened
exactly the same way
do you feel like you have this problem
right or like a power question
just write down like three or five of
those things that can keep the
conversation going if the pacing lulls
out
and I would also write out just a couple
of
reasons
why you feel like this company is like
really doing different or power words
too you could just list power words the
whole process will take about 10 to 15
minutes max right probably less
and I think you'll have some really good
ammo to go into like an interview type
of situation combined with those
techniques but this kind of works
anywhere all right so that's what I
would do thank you for watching let me
know what you think bye
