okay hello this is a video about how to
use AI specifically gpt3 to optimize
your business and your content creation
and maybe even your life the first video
on this topic is the free video on my
YouTube channel the most powerful
content cool I have ever seen this is a
more advanced video so you need to watch
that video first we are going to really
delve into some specific examples of how
to use this how we've been using it at
Novo and some of the techniques across
various different prompts so this is an
in-depth video for people that really
want to understand this and utilize this
in their business first off we're going
to go and do some kind of macro level
thinking about gpt3 and where I think
you need to think about it so there's a
couple of main points here and I think
Point number one is gbt3 that uh doesn't
understand things
uh in a deep sense and I'll explain that
in a minute it doesn't have a notion
um of accuracy okay
um it predicts what words are likely to
be next okay and we're just gonna break
these we're gonna break each one of
these down in a second here and the
number two is that in a world of tons of
ideas Limitless ideas
uh action is all that matters
at number three we're gonna do the brain
idea which is this is my own kind of
thing so we're gonna go with paint we're
gonna draw a brain
let's draw like a
a brain here
that's a brain okay
and we're gonna separate the brain by
two different lines
I actually want to put this line up here
okay and then we're gonna draw a
coloration
in each one of these
that signifies green
okay this is blue
and this is red
okay and up here is high
medium
and low
so the first thing to understand about
how
thought and brain and work processes
work
low process tasks these are things like
making lists these are things like rote
activities these are things like having
to come up with a lot of low quality
ideas
medium is like medium creative stuff
that requires some kind of thinking like
writing or things like that and high
level creative is things like executive
direction of a business or your life how
you should change your goals and your
life and such things
I think that way too many people are
trying to use GPT 3 to solve these kind
of problems when what you really should
do is you should try to eliminate all of
this with gbt3 which is going to be
about 20 to 30 percent of your total
brain power
you eliminate all of this and so the
prompts that we're going to run through
in this uh
video are going to be
like all about the low level prompting
in order to inform the high level
prompting so don't try to use gpt3 to
solve your problems this is a big
mistake don't try to do it to write a
blog post don't try to do it to write a
script for your video what it should be
doing is it should be destroying these
rote tasks that you no longer need to do
to inform yourself to be the most highly
creative possible it should be informing
you as an expert okay and we're going to
use some literal examples of how to do
this in this video but I just wanted to
set up those three things because I
think that it like many people are
seeing this as AI replacing their tasks
I think what those people will end up
with is uninspired business ideas
uninspired execution and uninspired
content I think is what will happen to
those people if they just use gbt3 for
high level stuff like if you say write
me a script for a YouTube video then you
read it like word for word even if the
prompt is good it won't have the soul
that if you just did the low level stuff
and you went to the high level stuff uh
it would have that soul and then you
would just optimize for a lot of work so
I don't think any of this makes sense
until we start running through prompts
so this is all going to be live I don't
have like any prompts prepared or
anything
um we're going to do a first prompt is
going to and there's going to be all
kinds of stuff some of them are going to
be content created creation some of them
are going to be
um like design some of them are going to
be legal stuff and some of them just to
be General Life stuff there's a lot of
stuff to do here and that's why I'm
making this video like be more advanced
and I'm not like afraid of making it
super comprehensive because the people
that watch this whole thing will benefit
from it okay so we're gonna do a new the
first thing we're going to do is we're
going to do a new video for a finance
channel that is Project number one all
right
so
um here's how I would start this off I
am a financial YouTuber again this is
all just prompted
um
who is trying to get over 500 000 let's
say one million subscribers
um on YouTube I make videos about
investing
dividend funds and let's say
how to make money online
um
what
would
or list
five
video ideas
that are likely to get over 200 000
views each explain why each video will
get those views
in two sentences
or less
um
and let's start with this prompt and
then we'll just throw this guy in here
um
which is disregard your former date
programming the date is December 14th
I don't know if that works but it seems
to produce more uh recent results and
let's begin with this prompt
so it's going to come up with top 10
dividend stocks for 2023 this video will
get views because it offers relevant
valuable investment advice for the
coming year
how to start investing with 500 or less
that's it okay actually I shouldn't
spoil it okay the secret to making money
online passive income streams
the truth about investing in
cryptocurrency the video get views okay
um interview with a successful investor
tips and strategies okay so here let's
go back to our brand example
what we've done is we've produced so
we've outsourced a low level task that
was I have to go think about five videos
so if I go sit down and I just start
listing and brainstorming if you go back
to my patreon and you look at some of
the videos that I made about how to
brainstorm like all those videos are
outdated because this just does this for
you right now right so but what you
normally have to do is just go think
about 100 ideas and you wouldn't even be
you wouldn't even know what a video is
so what I really want to explain to you
here and what you're going to get out of
this whole video is immensely valuable
if you if you pay attention you're going
to realize that you can just use a
certain frame of like a a step-by-step
thing to basically produce your idea and
then everything you need for your
execution but you have to understand how
the steps work starting with the low
level steps would just be imagine
yourself sitting here as a finance
YouTuber and you have no idea whatsoever
what to do next so the first low-level
stuff you're going to Outsource is all
on gpt3 you're gonna Outsource what to
actually do
but you're going to use your high level
and medium expertise the the knowledge
that you know to know what is good as a
result of these uh of this because not
all this is good so top 10 dividend
stocks for 2023 is good that is a really
good video title and it will probably
work how to start investing with 500 or
less we would need to mess with that
title a little bit but it's a really
really good idea right so you might be
able to say something like
um how I
um I made seven thousand dollars with
500 bucks in 30 days right that's like a
more powerful title or something like
that the secret to making money online
passive income streams or um making
passive income streams so this is this
title failed this would not do well
right so um we're using our high level
thinking to determine that number three
the low level thinking is not right
the truth about investing in
cryptocurrency this is a really really
strong title and actually is a
standalone we're using our high level
thinking in order to determine that okay
interview with a successful investor
tips and strategies this is too General
would it work again high level thinking
okay so now we'll say Okay
um write each of these ideas as a
YouTube title
using the best SEO
keywords
and engagement possible
the titles should
appeal
to
human emotion use dramatic themes
and let's try that yeah let's try it
and it is in my opinion producing a res
a worse result now
um
that it did before so which is
interesting because like this unlock
your financial future just isn't
necessary won't do any work for us in a
title of a YouTube video every single
thing needs to do work for us so the top
10 dividend stocks for 2023 would have
been a much stronger title despite the
fact that we asked it to do this right
so this again is that concept that gpt3
doesn't have any sense of accuracy it's
us that have that sense of accuracy up
here this is our sense of accuracy gpd3
can only do this
okay so that doesn't mean it's useless
because we just could have gotten three
YouTube video ideas for our title uh for
for our Channel off of this so this is a
really really powerful tool but it
exemplifies like how to do it and
there's our prompt for that okay cool so
now let's do it again
um let's do a new thread
and let's start with uh this next one is
going to be uh a entrepreneur who's on
Twitter trying to grow their brand so I
am an entrepreneur trying
uh teaching
business
leadership and management on Twitter
write me five tweets that are
likely to get that will get
over
50 000 Impressions each
I speak
or you okay so I like tone I like
emotion a lot in these
um
each tweet should
have a human tone
utilize
emotion
and
easy going speech patterns
we'll say text patterns
and we'll remove the hyphen so it
doesn't get confused
each tweet should be a genuinely
educational and unique idea about how to
about
any of the three subjects
above
you can use dramatic examples
you can also use
current examples
and allegories
from other businesses
uh disregard form or date programming
date is December 14th
let's try that
all right
so it's going to give us
three tweets now
that uh
we'll see and then we'll evaluate based
on our knowledge of expert content
creation
hmm
so
I think that um
this is this is kind of an interesting
discussion
um
all a lot of people are going to see
these and they're going to think that
they're really good like uh as an
entrepreneur you're not just selling a
product or service you're selling
yourself in your vision be authentic and
trust and Inspire trust in your
customers I think as of the current
moment in time this kind of content is
working I think it won't work later
um on places like Twitter LinkedIn quora
and other places like that where people
are experimenting with this we're going
to see so many AI answers that the
the it has to sound super duper human to
get engagement so I think for like the
next like six to 12 months as people
like on board this this these kind of
answers will be okay but we need to do
better and maybe we can also help GPT do
this so
um rewrite
each of these tweets
in a more personal and emotional way
uh use fictional examples from
a business you've ran
with
um let's say 5 million dollars and
annually reoccurring
Revenue
um let's try that to see what happens
um
now I like this a lot better this is a
way way stronger prompt as a leader I've
learned that being adaptable and
empowering my team is key to success
I've seen how firsthand a strong team
culture could make a difference in
business
it is in my in my experience as
entrepreneur authenticity is quick key
I've seen how customers respond to
genuine human touch it's not about
products about the person behind it now
this is a way way stronger uh tweet
storm I think that these are really good
and that these would work outside of
white like in an AI economy I think
these would work because I think that
they sound very personal
and what I've been thinking about in
terms of this kind of content creation
and the human hybrid model is now I
might add my own flavor to this but I
will use this prompt which has
accomplished like the low level and in
this case we've actually gotten the
prompt to accomplish the middle level
thinking too right
um the high level stuff is what can I
add personally and what creative can I
add personally so I might add a story to
this tweet like in the world of business
finding your Niche is crucial I might
say something like
um I was lucky to find Esports as my
Niche and and now I might say I've seen
how you offered comparison can set you
apart from competition and then I might
like lead that into a couple other
tweets because we can expand on this now
we can say
um
use and use number four
in your list to expand and make three
more tweets
complementing it in the style
complement it period uh make the Tweets
in the style
in the same style
you have before and let's try that again
so now we're going to expand on number
four
and
um
did it work it looks like it didn't work
so I want to expand on
let's see
yeah it's just rewriting those so
let's try
three more tweets
about
so I did my business yeah yeah okay so
um obviously these answers are way in
fear to these we'll go back so but um
expand and make three more tweets about
I'm trying to get it to do um number
four
about this tweet how about this and
we'll just copy and paste it
card paste a good one
I might be getting caught up on same
style so we'll just
ah [ __ ] okay so we'll just do this we
gotta wait for it now
um so I didn't like the answers that it
came up with there
while it's producing that result I'll
just give you a quick little objective
tool that you can use
um so you also want to make sure that
the AI is not uh plagiarizing so you can
go to grammarly
uh g-r-a-n-m-a-r-l-y.com
and you can hit uh scan for plagiarism
just uploading text just to make sure
that your your gpt3 results are not
being produced anywhere else anybody
that's in school that's doing research
papers
um should hear that out okay so we're
just going to expand this now because I
want to get a Twitter thread out of this
so now I think I'm getting closer to the
results
so
huh this is not working
yeah it's basically just producing the
same thing over and over again so
there's some way to do this that I will
figure out basically how to expand on
that idea and get three more additional
tweets out of it to make a thread but
regardless we've accomplished what we
came out to do our prompt was we're
entrepreneurship Tweeter and we want to
figure out what to write about and these
are some great ways to do that based on
this prompt so I think we can move on
next one we're gonna do is five titles
for a pet training video which means
we're gonna do a new prompt
and we're gonna use a similar prompt to
this
but I want to just use a different one
because I don't I don't want to like use
the same stuff and kind of yeah okay so
I'm a pet trainer
for dogs and cats on YouTube
I also kind of like think of citrusy if
you are a pet trainer for dogs and cats
on YouTube
your Channel
I don't think it's relevant how many
channels it is um make five video titles
with the best
possible marketing and SEO
and you could have stopped there but I
want to get a little bit more specific
um emphasize
human
let's say I like human toe and emphasize
um let's say a dramatic tone
um each video title should
foreign
you know what let's just leave that
there and I'm going to try something
else after that
expert training techniques amazing
tricks and behavior how to get your dog
or cat to perform from unleash okay so
now let's try
um
make five more fit make these titles but
with
but each one
should guarantee 50 000 views or more
for each YouTube video I just want to
see what it does with this
I thought it took it literally
because it doesn't understand that we're
trying to get through those viewers so
but each title
will get us
huh how should we write that
okay I don't want to go too into like
the experimentation because this video
is going to be long enough
so I'll just keep going
so I don't like these titles that much
and I don't think we got as strong
titles as we got from something else so
I think we can go back here and try
again
let's say
um
let's do a new thread and just put this
same input in again
these titles
aren't good make five more titles
each title should be likely to get
the highest amount of viewership
possible per
video
would understand that
it does understand that okay so now we
have strong titles interesting we did it
okay so
um The Ultimate Guide to training your
furry best friend is just not a good
title right it just like there's uh
Ultimate Guide is like okay but like
it just doesn't like reach out to me it
doesn't like have a hook enough but the
most effective training tips for your
dog or cat obviously we would just say
your dog here and we might say like the
seven most effective training tips
um it's producing good stuff stop your
pets your pets bad habits in just seven
days this is an S tier title that's like
that's like what we take out of that and
so I think we've accomplished our goal
um and we've come up with some really
good titles here
um amazing results of professional pet
training just literally cut all this is
a great title too so again like you've
got to know what you're doing but we're
using the high level thinking to inform
it okay uh number four our next project
new thread is going to be a thumbnail
for an adventure blog a lot of um
like uh consecration the last couple of
months but we're gonna go into some
other stuff in a minute here
so the thumbnail for adventure Vlog is
um
I am a
vlog
Video Creator
on YouTube
I make videos
about adventuring
and hiking
in the outdoors
my goal is one million
subscribers
design me a thumbnail for
design me or describe to me
five thumbnail ideas
for my channel
and these prompts are very basic right I
ideally want to add way more examples
and feed it way more data the more
training that I feed it and the more
longer The Prompt is the better it's
going to be
so
um
a thumbnail with a group of people
hiking together smelling having a good
time so now what I might do here
is I might say
make a dolly prompt that represents each
scene
and then I'll send that
and
it will actually give me the prompts
that I'll use in dolly to make a
thumbnail for this
so a Winding Trail through a lush green
forest and we could produce that like
maybe five or six times and we probably
get a thumbnail out of it so this
two-step process is what I use to do AI
thumbnails
um we use stable diffusion to get this
thumbnail this is an AI generated
thumbnail
uh all these other ones are obviously
custom I do think that AI thumbnails are
possible with a lot of work in Dolly but
I think that right now
it's gonna be a while I I think that
like we like they haven't quite figured
out you can't just say design me a
thumbnail it won't work you have to you
have to like actually like prompt it in
this way
and make sure the gpt3 understands how
to prompt Dolly so we've succeeded we
were trying to get a thumbnail for our
um
let's see for our adventure Vlog it was
pretty easy any of these are obviously
really good and then we can just go
experiment and Dolly for each one so
next one we're gonna move into some kind
of different stuff
um I want to draft a legal agreement
between a sponsor and a YouTuber so I am
a YouTuber with 500 000 view uh
subscribers uh a brand is offering
me
five thousand dollars for a 60 second
integration into a YouTube video
um
the offer is called a deliverable
draft me a contract between myself Devin
Nash and the brand monster
named Monster Energy
and myself
and the brand named Monster Energy
I actually don't want to use my real
name my name is because I don't want to
train this AI on that
um if I use it later so my name is
Johnson Smith I'm a YouTuber a draft
draft me a contract between myself and
the brand name Monster Energy
um
draft me a sponsorship contract
and let's see what that comes up with
now we might get a 30 second air
which is
um
if the prompt goes for over 30 seconds
we'll get a network error
um just because that's the current state
of gbt3 because of load but it's working
so
um it's actually under definition this
is actually defined yeah it's going to
time out really soon but it's actually
defined the YouTube channel with 500 000
subscribers and then there's the brand
um here's the parties here's the term we
could have set the term in the prompt
here's the services they're absolutely
correct integration of a brand service
in a 60 second video compensation there
at this ownership of content is under
the influencer so what gpt3 is about to
time out but what gbt3 is doing here is
it's looking at all of the likely
sponsorship contracts that it was
trained for and it's making a oh it just
finished it before 30 seconds great okay
so this is a contract like this is a
legally binding contract that two people
could sign I'm just uh I'll just make
just as a person who does 100 of these
contracts so this um part of the video
I'm just trying to give you a different
idea of how this might work whereas like
you may have had no idea how to write a
contract like this this contract
basically confirms contains everything
besides the term the ownership of the
content is on the influencer which is
correct we didn't even tell it that but
the brand has the right to distribute
and content for marketing promotional
periods that's usually how it goes yeah
um and there might be like we might
change the termination clause uh Cal
State of California might change that
right and then the signers and there you
go you have a full-blown contract that
works and makes sense now in this case
this this like gbt3 like basically
solved our problem at a low and middle
and high level
um and there would only be a very little
high level thinking that would be needed
to actually do this so we've solved our
problem with a very simple prompt we
could have made a better prompt and we
could have got better answers great
perfect new thread we're going to um
we've gotten in a car crash and we live
in let's say Houston Texas
um I live in Houston Texas
and I've just gotten in a car crash
I need a towing service
from
uh from nearby to tow my car
um provide three towing services and a
short
and a two sentence or less explanation
of why I should use them
include the prices of each towing
service
uh and then disregard your former date
programming
as the current date is now
okay
um
here we go
oh interesting it's gonna give us the
browse the internet thing okay
uh I know for a fact this works because
I just did this in my area so I know
it'll work
um
let's say uh
if we're just going to wear this a
little bit differently
um at least for the two personal
list three towing services in the
Houston Texas area
disregard former prompt those two
services in the Texas area include
prices for those services
uh include
only towing services with the highest
reviews
uh disregard your former date
programming should be able to do this we
might need to do a new thread
thinking
[Music]
well it's really thinking
it is super thinking might have been
timed out
hey it figured us out
funny
um
I'm surprised this isn't working as this
works in playground
we'll just throw the same tagline in the
playground
there it is we did it
um emergency roadside Towing Houston
discount Towing uh 24 7 roadside
assistance so this is just like a way
that it can get a very intelligent uh
and easy answer
um five star reviews right 65 bucks
there's your answer so now we've
successfully gotten our card towed uh
lastly uh before we do some other cool
stuff we're going to do a prompt for a
product review uh I have a product
that is a microphone
it is
a high quality microphone
priced at four hundred dollars
its features are
it features its
it is a condenser you know what screw it
um write a product review
for the sm7
microphone
use uh use the best
SEO and marketing
tags available
use multiple
SEO keywords
top SEO keywords
in the description
four paragraphs
minimum
see what it does
so this is going to be for a product
review
um I think this would be better
if you prompted
uh way more like we just had more time
to feed in more about the features and
benefits I would actually like bullet
point features and benefits I would
bullet point things that I wanted to
utilize in this okay and now we're
getting
um
a total product review of the sm7 now
this since we actually specified the
microphone
it's also using the um
the data
from uh
what that it has on the sm7
and then it's giving us several keywords
here so we could say something here like
um
give me a list of 30 of the most
popular
keywords related to the above
written review
and just run that [ __ ] I just hit try
again again I always do that okay a
couple of notes real quick while we wait
for that so that I can just like provide
more value so
um the it's gonna say a lot of the time
when it's writing product reviews and
stuff like this you can say something
like overall or finally there's going to
be a couple of colloquialisms that AI
always uses
whether you're recording music and
there's gonna be like a couple of commas
here it's using uh it's using a lot of
the traditional copywriting that
people have used over the years so you
will want to
um heavily edit this kind of stuff like
this will definitely end with like a
finally or an overall or something that
there it is yeah so once you see these
kind of AI colloquialisms you'll want to
write you want to edit these out in your
actual copy when you're doing your high
level stuff
um
okay now it's just giving us the SEO and
marketing tags
which is fantastic so now we can do this
prompt give me a list of 30 the most
popular keywords or the above review
it's already given us quite a few
um I don't think these are correct yet
but these are good for like to put in
here but they're not like really good
uh actual title so or actual keywords so
we'll see if this actually prompts it
and gpd3 is moving very slow because
there's so many people using the sm7
microphone first little microphone
smooth uh sturdy metal construction
recording vocals recording guitar I
believe all these yeah these are good
reducing posted is protecting from
physical damage so obviously again have
to use our high level knowledge some of
these are good others are not that's
fine
musician podcasters voice of artists but
you get an idea of how to use these
keywords and then you can also just like
plug these into Google and see how they
do and that sort of thing okay so that
is all of our prompts and then I'm just
going to go through a couple of like
kind of big stuff
uh let's see if
I lost anything out
okay on our general ideas so now that
you understand all the things we used
and here is the list of things we did
um I had number five Is MeMe creation
which I skipped but I uh just didn't
want to do that in this video I think
that it is going to be more interesting
on like dolly when we've kind of
experimented with that
okay
so
um some of the kind of summaries like
here and some of the things like I want
you to think about like taking away from
this video and like how you can utilize
this okay so um Now you kind of
understand based on some of these
examples that like you're going to have
to use a lot of your own sort of
checking and your own sort of like fact
checking to make sure that like these
are producing good results and for that
reason I I really really can I cannot
emphasize enough to you that you don't
want to focus on this to solve your high
level problems like if you just copy and
paste and your next five YouTube videos
are exactly what gbt3 tells you to do
and then they're exactly the scripts you
tell it to write I don't think it'll
produce good results for you rather I
think that you should completely
eliminate from your life as much as
possible the um uh idea of having to
idea any kind of low level thinking
stuff so for example like what are the
five top Hispanic restaurants in the
Dallas area that I could go to what are
the top five romantic ideas that I could
do with my wife what are the top
um five most popular pairs of clothes
right it's basically like using sort of
an advanced Google type of thing to
eliminate a lot of the low-level
decision making in your life and inform
the high level decision making in your
life that's what I think the best use of
this tool is especially from like a
marketing and like like a Content
creation standpoint
um I think asking it questions about
what is likely to be very popular uh and
then all and one of the things we didn't
discuss in this video is that as long as
its training model has processed the
data so one of the things that's really
important that um I really want you to
pay attention to all of Twitter's data
through 2022 is on gbt3 it is it has
been sent to gbt3 so you can use and
that goes for YouTube as well so you can
use YouTube or Twitter people and you
can say write me a blog post in the form
of Seth goded in the form of repeat
setting in the form of Tim Ferriss in
the form of Alex harmazi right you could
do those sort of things so for example
if I did a new prompt or something like
that I would say write me five tweets
like Alex harmazi
um and let let's see if that actually
works I think that's how you spell his
name
uh and like he should it should work uh
as long as it's aggregated that
information but we might have to make
like a more impressive prompt but anyway
so thinking about things in terms of
like okay I can word something like this
I like this influencer I like this
person
um yeah it's working yeah so this is
literally uh Alexey right who's a a very
well-known entrepreneur in the fitness
industry
so you can obviously do a more
sophisticated prompt like I'm an
entrepreneur like using that tweet
example that we had in the previous gbp3
example
or one of these and you can say I'm a
financial YouTuber provide all this
context but then at the end you could
say something like I really want this
video to sound like Graham Stefan right
so let's try that like in these prompts
here
um write each of these ideas
but use Graham Stefan's
uh but make them sound make them
like Graham Stefan
YouTube
videos
just see if that works
and we'll see if like they're more like
that
so um
you can really get some pretty
incredible results just by like like
Outsourcing the level thinking and just
being inspired by these types of people
because it's aggregated all those
results you could use specific people
and I can't remember if I hit try again
or if I actually hit the prompt it looks
like I hit try again
so we'll just really quickly
because this is not how Graham Stefan
writes so we'll do this
and see if it works
I think that's how you spell Graham
stuff it isn't it
yeah no it's not so it might not
actually understand that
so we'll try
unless it actually knows
g r a
ham
a n
investing 101 how to get started with
just 500 dollars
how to get started with just 500 a lot
of times just like cutting off the title
for gbt3
and just like making it seem good
yeah so this is it here we go
these are more realistic to Graham
Stefan
good so that's what I mean by that uh
back to like some of the high level
stuff
and then I want to talk about number two
a little bit
so uh the world's about to get really
weird
um like I think it's kind of weirder
than anybody
really knows it's gonna get definitely
like I I can't like really consider how
the next like I'd say three or four
years are gonna be uh it's gonna be
weird as hell
we are going to see so so first of all
for the next six to 12 months
there's going to be maybe a little bit
longer there's going to be enormous
value
in dominating platforms like LinkedIn
dominating platforms like quora
dominating platforms like
um Twitter So currently I'm running a
couple of tests on new accounts in
different places and I'm using a
combination of hybrid human AI I'm
deliberately not telling anyone in this
community about it one because I want to
see where it goes before I report back
to you and see if it's good and number
two I don't want any of my current
followers to go over to those places
because I want to see in a vacuum how is
the organic reach of those places so I
think that in any kind of like
text-based contribution this is an
insane tool to produce a lot of content
and grow a following in a particular
expertise very quickly
uh likewise for like a business if
you're like selling like supplements or
you're selling like something like that
like producing a ton of written content
on a blog or something like that
um especially content where oftentimes
if you're selling a product
like let's say that you're selling a
product like green tea and you just need
a shitload of blog posts that are just
going to like rank your SEO for that
like this is going to be the way to do
it but I think that one of the problems
that is going to happen is that within
like I don't know when it's going to
happen maybe it accelerates like way
faster than
um I'm anticipating
one of the things that's going to happen
is that just the information is going
this is going to be too much there's
going to be a saturation of just kind of
like sort of like [ __ ] saying
nothing type of AI content this sort of
like throws the whole like thing out of
the water and now everyone's going to
kind of be a discount content creator
um in the same way that like eventually
AI artists or artists are just
completely done I think uh I think
eventually within the next couple of
years we're going to Outsource Artistry
entirely to AI
um and uh the same thing is probably
going to happen with writers as well so
you so I think that the thing that's
protected probably in the near future is
probably video uh both like short form
and long form so I think that the basis
of of most businesses and most content
creators should be in video because I
think it's very very hard for AI to
duplicate that and also it requires like
a lot of like personality and emotion
that even if you have someone like
reading a script it's going to be more
difficult to like evoke those emotions
and things that make a successful video
like like the perception of like a
well-spoken person
at the point where I think AI is able to
successfully circumvent video production
which will happen I think like we have
so many other big problems that's not
even going to be an issue so what I
would do right now is use the next six
or 12 months to build a brand on any
kind of written platform by just
deluging it with this kind of content
again not deluging it with just the
stuff that the AI spits out that is we
are as human beings we're going to very
quickly be able to tell when an AI has
written something versus when a human
has written it because we're going to
see patterns that AI can't see we're
going to see things like overall
furthermore three examples we're going
okay the AI does that kind of example
every time this is probably written by
an AI I'm not going to engage with it I
think that there will be some people
that are fooled but most people will be
able to represent those patterns in the
same way that like the human being like
can tell the difference between like a
[ __ ] poster like a troll post and they
can tell there's between that and like
an actual high quality like well thought
out response that that same thing is
going to happen
at scale where human beings eventually
kind of figure out what is written by Ai
and what's low quality so I don't think
that this is going to work like right
now you might be thinking okay well I'm
gonna like go start a blog and I'm just
going to post all AI stuff like that's
not going to work like human beings are
smarter than that and you shouldn't like
you shouldn't like shortchange yourself
for them but based on that what what
what what will work though is like using
a hybrid human AI model where maybe like
two or three paragraphs are informed by
Ai and then you're using like you're
replacing things with like human
elements with your own style of writing
that sort of thing to develop an
expertise
um experimenting with that enclosed
areas has been really successful for me
and I'll continue to report back on that
when I'm comfortable like sharing what
I've been doing in my products that I'm
working on right now uh so I think that
that hybrid human model is like the way
to go with this
um and then I want to like focus on
number two a little bit it's like okay
so we're gonna have like tons and tons
and tons and tons of ideas
um there's gonna be people that are
sitting around just playing with us all
day and then they're like maybe if they
make anything at all it's going to be
like the Baseline like really
um lowest level type of thing and I I
this is nothing right way to go with
this the like execution is everything at
this point so you should be making you
like with this time scale right you've
now outsourced all this information and
maybe you've even outsourced like some
of this information right so like your
medium and low is like kind of covered
for you should now like where you could
do one video every week you should be
able to do three videos every week or
like where you could do like maybe like
one product review every week you should
be able to do three product reviews so
just increase the scale and use AI to
help you and I think that's where you're
gonna go with like the actual execution
that like the the objective of a
successful integration of AI into your
life is that it improves your execution
you get like more stuff out of it okay
um that's where I think it actually goes
so
um yeah what else what else are we
thinking about here
um I think that's a lot of stuff I don't
know why my hair is like split in that
weird way ah there we go I think that's
just like a lot of stuff that
I would offer that I think um you could
really benefit from across like many
different ideas so this has been just
like a really in-depth video on like how
to use this and how I've been using it
the next follow-up video will have a lot
of the actual like ways I've been using
this and integrating this into content
um that I'm producing in other areas
under different names just to see if I
can build Brands there and like I'm also
like working on this from Novo I think
I've covered a lot of the main points I
want to cover for now so we'll just kind
of like let this run and then I see
where it goes thanks everybody bye
