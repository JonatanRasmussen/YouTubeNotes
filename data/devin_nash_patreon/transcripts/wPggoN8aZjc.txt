so i want to talk about something
very very important and it has to do
with
the last video that i made called the
best social media marketing strategy in
2021. this was on the main youtube and
it basically talked about how youtube is
moving towards more of a recommendation
strategy and kind of all social media
and platforms are moving towards it and
this response surprised me and made me
realize that i wanted to make a video
that talked about this that's going to
take a while to develop but if you bear
with me i think it's going to be really
important
so a lot of people took away from this
video
they agreed or disagreed with that that
some people think that youtube is
getting more niche for example some of
the larger creators that responded to me
or messaged me told me that they felt
like it was the opposite of what i was
saying some people
responded at mastermind chat which is
our you know our patreon chat and said
um that they they didn't feel like the
sort of new age of marketing like 39
daff or um any of these people that are
making these like short youtube titles
was
very good and i realized that
um i think that the majority of people
that are in marketing or advertising or
people that we're listening to sort of
miss the point and maybe that's because
of the way that i explained it so
i'm going to do this because this is a
patreon video it might go to youtube but
i doubt it i'm going to treat it like a
patreon video which means that i can be
more casual about what i'm doing and i'm
going to talk about um something that i
do offline that i don't talk about a lot
which is that i'm a very devout zen
buddhist i spend a lot of time
practicing and thinking about zen and
there's a great book by suzuki suzuki
was pretty much one of the people that
brought
zen to america one of the two people i'd
say it's him and alan watts for the
people that really made zen buddhism a
popular thing in the west i'm going to
read you
a
portion of the beginning of the book
and then we're going to talk about this
concept as it relates to marketing i
promise if you bear with me there will
be it'll be really important it'll be
really worth doing
people say that practicing zen is
difficult but there is a
misunderstanding as to why it's not
difficult because it is hard to sit a
cross-legged position or to attain
enlightenment it is difficult because it
is hard to keep our mind pure and our
practice pure in its fundamental sense
the zen school developed in many ways
after it was established in china but at
the same time it became more and more
impure but i don't want to talk about
chinese zen or the history of zen i'm
interested in helping you keep your
practice from becoming imper
in japan we have the phrase shoshen
which means beginner's mind the goal of
practice is always to keep our beginners
mind suppose you recite a sutra only
once it might be a very good recitation
but what would happen to you if you
recited it twice three times four times
or more you may easily lose your
original attitude towards it the same
thing will happen in your other zen
practices for a while you will keep your
beginner's mind but if you continue to
practice one two three years or more
although you may improve some you are
liable to lose the limitless meaning of
the original mind
so what this what suzuki is saying here
is that there's a certain mindset that
when you start with something like
content creation or starting a business
you're open to many more possibilities
and there's another quote that i think
is also his end quote that says in the
beginner's mind there are many
possibilities and in the expert minds
there are few
and i think that is the
the takeaway and sort of the the trap i
would use that word that strongly use
that word that i think many people are
falling into and i'm going to read a
comment from the mastermind session here
um to kind of extenuate what i mean so
here in in our discord um there's a
creator
named eposvox who i've been really
impressed with just writing some really
incredible insightful stuff in our
mastermind chat
and um
i just want to read a little bit of of
this at the beginning of this is that um
this
in response to my video on experience
marketing shorter less seo oriented
titles the exact kind of thing that
makes me want to vomit and why i get
stuck with sales if i'm buying tea for
example i don't want to be fed some bs
about how it will change my life i just
want to buy the t and see how it
compares these kind of things feel
incredibly condescending and really
actually feel relatable why would i use
this to sell my own stuff if anything
it's the idea to create this made-up
story rather than presenting sold info
that hates me sales more i just don't
get it um so this goes on to say this is
a long conversation it's really worth
reading there's a lot of people that
that come into it that add a lot uh
and i and i i wanted to make a video and
related to this is kind of like what
this video is
and and that's to say that
i i i hear this a lot this pushback on
things like the the title like
um bro please no more tomatoes or my
grandpa got owned
right like these titles and people say
or or there's just like a history of
like
pages and pages of copy where it's like
um do you want to get more chicks get
ripped and um make a ton of money like
do this now big red letters things like
that a lot of people that push back
against this
and they think that there is something
inauthentic about this they think that
there's some kind of um
it's all it's like it's like this sort
of like judgment call almost that like
this is like not
marketing it in its appropriate sense
marketing should be true it should be
authentic or it should be a certain way
that speaks directly to the value of the
features and benefits of products and
there's sort of a sliminess there's a
feeling that this doesn't
fit if it's not like this um
and i'm here to tell you that that
mindset is
entirely contrived by your own consumer
habits which do not reflect the behavior
of average consumers and actually don't
reflect the behavior of you as a
consumer although you don't realize it
so every person individually would like
to think that they are these um
indomitable unmovable
objects of faith and discipline that
only
respond to product offerings that are
pure features and benefits and don't
respond to any kind of this type of
marketing uh but time and time again the
this is shown uh through numerous
advertising and marketing studies and
and just
relative behavior i mean if you just run
any business for a while you'll see this
that this kind of marketing draws people
in again and again and again and i say
this kind of marketing because
even that statement this kind of
marketing implies that there's a kind of
marketing that this is and a kind of
marketing that it isn't
and this reminds me of the second zen
story that i'm going to tell so
there is a monk who's training in japan
and
one of the questions in zen that you get
asked the first question if you've ever
been to a
a school as endo
they say who are you really and you've
got to produce a good answer for this
and sometimes it takes weeks or months
to go back and forth where you meet with
the master and try to give them a good
answer so there's a zen monk who's been
at this for a while and he's traveling
or he's traveling around the the zendo
the school
and he's trying to answer the question
of who he really is he has to present
this answer to this master every time he
keeps getting it wrong
so he's frustrated and he looks over and
he sees this bullfrog he sees a
common sight in japan he sees a bullfrog
and he stuffs it in his sleeves the
master comes and says who are you really
and he pulls out the bullfrog and
presents it to the master the master
looks at it and he says
now it's too intellectual try again
and what he means by it is it's too zen
it's too meta it's it's too much like
the thing this is the trap that i see
everybody getting cut and when they're
thinking about marketing or advertising
in some way it's too much marketing it's
too much like the meta it's too much to
be authentic that's what's what
everybody is thinking like these um
these titles are too much marketing
right or or um but there's some people
that say the same about like the seven
growth tips that you would use to grow
your business this is too zen it's too
much like marketing and what i'm here to
tell you is that if you want to be
successful you have to abandon all
notion of all these things and realize
that you are a mercenary that's the
lesson here you're a mercenary it
doesn't matter if it's seo titles it
doesn't matter if it's my grandpa got
owned what matters is the attention
economy what matters is what you draw in
what matters is the result that you
produce regardless of what strategy you
use to do it people will spend hours
debating the growth tactics
that work whether it's this thumbnail or
that thumbnail or whether it's
this title or that title and they'll get
lost in the meta of it and that was what
suzuki was talking about when he talked
about the loss of beginner's mind that
when
you start thinking about all of these um
all of these strategies and all of these
like techniques and things that work or
don't work for various reasons you're
getting lost in the pos you're losing
possibilities is what you're doing and
that's why um i don't talk about this
this often but but like any strategy
that i give you on this channel or any
or on other channels or anything
it's a strategy to be considered in the
context of the sort of toolbox that
you're going to use for growing your
business or your content or whatever and
the more that you delve into that
strategy and you become attached to it
whether you're attached to it negatively
or positively
the more that you shortchange yourself
from the possibilities you should be
using the most click bait seo titles
possible in one out of every five of
your videos and see what happens and you
should also be using things that you
think are authentic or appeal to you
better and see how you feel but the fact
that so many people are attached to this
outcome as if like there's a certain
good or bad type of marketing
it is reminiscent that they're limiting
their possibilities or the scope of what
is possible and that is not good
but that will that will limit you in the
long term both mentally and financially
rather the way that i see it is i will
make a video with the most clickbait
title possible because i am delivering
value or content that i think should be
in the hands of the most amount of
people possible i have no reservations
that like what i do is like good or evil
um
and i use some like really quick bait
titles like seven success secrets to
becoming a top one percent streamer or
logan paul teaches us networking and my
videos that recently that have done very
well have been extremely short titles
in terms of youtube marketing and
they've been uh typically like unrelated
to anything so that i i i've said before
that like i think
youtube as a whole when we're talking
about youtube marketing and the reason i
talk about youtube marketing so much is
because it's just a corollary to every
other form of marketing like you can use
this on email you can use this in any
kind of attention getting and the
advertisements you write for your
restaurant business whatever it is
youtube is a really good place to think
about this
shorter and more direct to the point
type of things do better than seo
in in this meta because of the way that
the recommendation system works but that
doesn't mean that seo doesn't work there
are plenty of people that are
using seo oriented titles and they're
doing fine but the lesson at least in
this video is to not get attached to
the technique but to get attached to the
outcome your your outcome is attention
right your outcome is to get people to
watch
have a longer watch time have a higher
completion rate and to engage with your
work more whether that be if you are in
a restaurant you want them to order more
or if you are a content creator you want
them to watch longer and for and and
more and be more engaged while doing it
or if you're a business owner you want
them to buy more product and then come
back and buy more product all this is
the same
it's just the tech things to get there
are many and there are tons of different
ways to succeed at this
but
so many people get stuck in this like
mindset that they can only
make like one type of thing one type of
way i challenge you to make one in every
three or at least one and every five of
the things that you produce whether it
be an advertisement or a video
or anything should be meaningfully
different from what you've done before
and it should scare you to do it
because if you don't
do that you're going to
you're going to limit your possibilities
a lot and
you've got to get out of the mindset
that
this um that there are these like right
and wrong ways to do things there are
some things that are more effective than
other things to do for sure but that
doesn't mean like let's say that
i don't know what the percentage is but
let's say that let's let's say a crazy
percentage i'll say that the recommended
system videos right because like here's
here's how i look at it in terms of
marketing okay
um i think that there's like three
different types of strategy really in
any kind of marketing there's growth
strategy
there's trend strategy and then there's
what's the third one seo strategy so
like
growth strategy is collaboration
or
website referrals or links on reddit
things like that right it's like classic
like growth strategy like posting stuff
everywhere
trend strategy is where you make
something
that
people are talking about
um so this would be like a video on like
the latest news or something
what the markets are doing seo is like
traditional
um using search engines
and
platforms for discovery
uh
based on their algorithms or techniques
right
um
and
can also be
like what you think
people will respond to the most
so let's say that like
growth strategy or let's say the trend
strategy is like
50
more effective
than
seo strategy is
like like
like say like trend strategy is 50 more
effects i'm not saying it is but let's
just say it is for like this example
should you discount seo strategy well no
like
if you get two viewers for every one you
get on seo strategy you still get one
for seo strategy there's plenty of
people that are doing one and they stay
on seo strategy they do just fine and
make multi-million dollar businesses the
lesson here is that the people that lose
are the people that are getting attached
to
the outcome or sorry not the the people
that are not attached to the outcome
people are attached to like the strategy
right like they sit in this and they say
oh should i do trend strategy should i
do seo strategy should i do a growth
strategy and then they end up not making
any videos
right like they end up not making any
actual advertisements or anything they
just like think about this and argue
about this all day it's a huge number of
people
i you have to think about why
um success
happens to certain people and doesn't
happen to other people i think about
this all the time i'm obsessed with this
idea and that's why i started that show
discussions with devon nash because i
just wanted to talk to people about why
they were successful and universally the
people that were successful
most of the time in rare instances
most of the time there were people who
just didn't know
anything about what we're talking about
so like if you go talk to like charlie
like moist critical for example he has
no knowledge of trend strategy seo grow
strategy things like that he has some
knowledge of it but he doesn't think
about it he he puts it he puts it behind
him the other people like ludwig for
example or people that i bring up a lot
or logan paul for example they might be
classically trained in these things they
might really intimately understand
something like seo or trend strategy but
they don't think about it they think
about producing they think about
creating they think about like putting
things first and ultimately
they just want to make sure that
something is in the world every day that
they've done um preferably every day
that's also my mentality is that uh no
matter what i did to research
uh like what the most effective
strategies are i spent a lot of time
offline considering podcasts and
listening to uh people that are thought
leaders in this industry so that i can
bring value to people because i need to
know a lot of stuff and understand a lot
of stuff very intimately to be able to
convey it i also need to practice it
right so spend a lot of time practicing
and doing my own marketing or running
hundreds of thousands of dollars in
budget on whether it be pay-per-click or
um
stores or merchandise or advertising
things like that
or deals whatever right i'm in i'm in
the business i'm i'm running agency in
real time uh creative agency
representing brands running these deals
calculating price of influencers so i
spend a lot of time in practice but the
most important thing that i do any day
is this this right here it's it's
producing this talk
um this will be out there it'll be
linked it'll be there for people to see
it's very very important that i do this
and then
like that is the the missing link for
like most people is that like you're
just not practicing the work like you're
not like doing it right like you you can
spend all this time
consuming
in like a basement all this knowledge
and you're a dark wizard and the only
difference between you and me right is
that i come out and i talk about it i'm
not afraid to do it
and
the problem the problem that a lot of
people run into is that they they spend
a lot of time accumulating or debating
on this knowledge and that's why like it
always blows my mind when i read like
reddit threads
and there are just thousands and
thousands of hours that are put into
this work that is just ephemeral that no
one really is going to read maybe one or
two people
that will really read your comment and
there are paragraphs and paragraphs like
factual data you can go
read like a subreddit that i read like
fat fire which is like a subreddit about
people that are trying to retire on what
very wealthy and people will write like
dissertations and stuff or
cryptocurrency subreddits or things like
that but they go nowhere like none of
this stuff ever
ever reaches anybody really like a
person might like read over it
cursory and like look at it but never
goes anywhere
whereas like you that same person could
produce a medium article or they could
produce like a
a linkedin post and they would get way
more engagement and they would they
would be able to build something about
that so why don't they do that
well i think it's because they know in
their mind that that reddit comment is
ephemeral and they don't have enough
faith or courage in themselves to know
that if they posted that on a platform
that would be more evergreen which is
not a hard thing to do they could
literally just copy and paste it it's
probably
one to one almost you wouldn't have to
change it almost at all as most of those
comments but they know that to do that
would have to they'd have to put
themselves out there they have to put
themselves behind what they're saying
that's hard to do and they don't want to
do that they instead they want to kind
of post something on like a platform
that they know
in a way it's irrelevant
right when you post it you know you
drive the car off the lot and it's
already losing value like it's that kind
of thing there's a lot of fear that's
attached to um the mentality of creating
content or creating advertisements you
don't want to put yourself behind it and
i'm telling you that the most important
thing you can do is sort of surrender
your notions behind like what is good or
bad marketing and what is this um
what what is this like idea of like a
good or bad business or how we get there
and to start practicing and the more
that you practice which i mean is
actually like doing the work like are
you creating something in the world
right now that physically exists that is
an improvement to your product service
or content right that's what you need to
be thinking about it's like the number
one thing the most important thing you
do every day is going to be like
actually producing sitting in front of
something and doing the hard thing it's
not easy but it's the most important
thing
okay so i think if there was anything i
would sum up it's that there are
actually a lot of lessons to learn from
the spiritual world it's one of the
reasons why i really like being able to
do videos like this one because i can't
do this on main youtube channel just
won't take off won't be good
but but here it's really relevant to a
core group of people who benefit a lot
from it
keep a beginner's mind
and everything
