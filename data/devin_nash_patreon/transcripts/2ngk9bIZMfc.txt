hello today we're going to talk about
where your customers live where your
customers actually participate in your
business this is a conversation that was
inspired by mastermind chat so i'm going
to go check that out and read it now
okay question i'm streaming on tick tock
getting 200 ish viewers i want to
convert them i'm thinking
multi-streaming to twitch and youtube at
the same time is not going to make as
much when i have an audience i want to
funnel i have a primary youtube uh do i
make a variety of youtube basically
where do i put these customers uh as a
response says i'm pretty sure twitch
converts better he says what i mean is
where do i bring my tech talk viewers to
i would be converting to twitch or tick
tock or to youtube etc so that's what
we're talking about today whether you
run a business or your content creators
can be relevant to you because you need
to know where your customers live so
the ref just to give a little bit of
context into like what he's talking
about
we live in a marketing ecosystem right
now where
driving viewers from certain places is
going to be easier than driving viewers
from other places so if you want to get
customers
acquiring customers from a place like
tiktok is going to be incredibly easier
or at least inquiry acquiring users but
turning those people into customers will
be more difficult so if you start
streaming on twitch today the likelihood
that you're going to build a business
off of that is extremely small but if
you start streaming on reddit or on
tiktok right now and that's your method
of user acquisition it will be much more
effective in fact ticktalk right now and
reddit are some of the best methods of
user acquisition ever but once you ha
and if you want to talk about user
acquisition you can go to a lot of my
videos where i cover that a lot but
today we're not talking about ua as much
we're going to be talking about what to
do with those users once you have them
so i'm going to give you a bunch of
different possibilities here on what you
could possibly do with those users and
in my opinion the best place to put them
so i want to break down just uh point by
point each one of these possibilities
and then we'll kind of talk through it
uh and and so uh and see where users
live so youtube
uh we'll talk about youtube real quick
and then we'll talk about tick tock
and talk about twitch streaming services
are all the same so we can kind of just
put them in there so again this is not
acquiring users this is not getting new
people to do something right this is
acquiring customers this is you have a
user who has been introduced to you in
some way
how do you
capture that user in a way that you can
now engage with that person sell them
things or you just want them to be
closer to your community whatever your
goal is we're going to talk about that's
what we're talking about okay so so it's
not the user acquisition part is how
does that person find you the first
place the second part of that is the and
there's a video i have on patreon which
is about funnels um and just how funnels
work so if you need more understanding
of that go watch that video it's really
important okay so typically things like
streaming services and tick tock and
twitter
uh are poor
places to hold audiences so a thing like
twitch is a poor place to hold an
audience because you don't control the
user right like you uh you can't message
them
or
or target them and also you don't know
the user right so you only know their
screen name
but no demographics name contact info
etc so you want to screen out
any platforms where this is true this is
also true on tick tock right both of
these are true
so in the exact same way tick tock is
not a great place to have a customer
base which means if you're a content
creator and you have a ton of followers
on tick tock but you don't but you don't
have
those followers doing anything else
which is the vast majority of people
you effectively
don't really have a user base that i'm
interested in as an agency or as a
sponsor
you know i we run
hundreds of thousands of millions of
dollars in sponsorship money we are less
interested in
a person who has
users or followers or whatnot or a
business that is doing on these services
because of these reasons right so
youtube is a little bit better about
this because you somewhat control the
user
because you can direct them to via
community posts which right now have as
of the time of this recording have very
high uh
receivable rates so community posts are
almost like emails in a way where you
can
expect most of your community to
actually see sorry and by community i
mean we have to get kind of granular
here because there's a bunch of
technical stuff
by community i mean the people who are
subscribed to your youtube channel
will most of them will see your
community post that's great right so
communicators are actually a legit way
to connect with your audience which is
something that uh tick tock and twitch
do not have but also you have the videos
themselves which can be expected to go
out to a high amount of subscribers
usually 60 plus
and you have
advanced
data and demographics
but you still can't contact an
individual user easily
and it's a little difficult
to upsell product
even more so
than a live streaming service
because if you are using your business
to acquire users and then do calls to
action on a live streaming service like
tick tock or twitch tick tock live
you actually have better opportunities
ctas will do better
like hey guys go buy this product than
they will on a youtube video just
because of the nature of live streaming
versus vaude
and the direct engagement you can do
so as a business if you're running three
streams
while you like let's say that you craft
something like you you craft a little
plushies or something and you run three
live streaming businesses or sorry three
live streams for your business every
week you will typically convert better
on those calls to action to selling
plushies to people than you would making
youtube videos about it now that
you could do both right and you should
do both but just just for the sake of
where your audience should live it's
more difficult to upsell product
on youtube now that's not always the
case sometimes
in activations youtube actually does
better
particularly for well-developed channels
but for smaller for smaller operations
to which most businesses will fall into
because most businesses aren't gonna
have two to three thousand five thousand
views if you can think about all the
streaming services like twitch
and youtube live there's not a single
business that's consistently running
like three to five concurrent viewers
right so most businesses aren't using
that as a method of user acquisition or
where their users should live
okay let's talk about twitter
so twitter
has a lot of the same problems
but you can you you don't know the user
right
because you only know
their screen name
and twitter profile but you can't
contact the user in most cases
and your ability to reach out to these
users is dependent on the platform
that's a problem right that's true for
all of these platforms which is why i
wouldn't recommend that your user base
actually exists on any of these
platforms
because you ultimately
although i'd say out of all the
platforms that are out there right now
you
probably have the most amount of control
and exposure on youtube but that's just
current meta
and if youtube decided to de-rank
community posts
or
they made it so less subscribers would
see your videos for whatever reason then
you would lose that power so it's not a
great place to control users
and to have and to have your users so
let's talk about some better stuff let's
talk about direct client
which to me means crm so crm is a
customer resource manager it means
something like pipedriver salesforce
where
you have a direct relationship
with a client
and you put them in a crm
this is
a great way
to and is the way that many
multi-billion dollar businesses to this
day
control their user base whether their
clients are businesses or
they are users this is a great way to do
it what you do is you establish a direct
relationship either through outbound
email or phone call or reference
whatever you want to use again this is
not a video about user acquisition you
get that user somehow you put their name
their phone number their company
everything they do into a crm and then
you put the notes
of what
you have done with that client in that
crm so let's say i'll just choose a
brand at random we're not actually like
representing these people let's say we
represent
walmart okay
i would have the contact from walmart in
that crm and there are many free crms
like pipedrive or sugar for example that
will do this for you so you don't need
to spend like a huge amount of money on
salesforce but everybody should have a
crm like if you're listening to this and
you have a business you should have a
crm even if your clients are
even if you're like a content creator
and your clients are like youtube
subscribers the people you do business
with the sponsors things like that you
want in the crm so let's say with
walmart i have established a
relationship with a vp there
i'm going to put down that vp's name i'm
going to
uh put all the information in and then
i'm actually going to put in like for me
personally i'm going to put in stuff
like likes cats or
particularly like this brand of water
i'll remember specific details about
that person through those notes as well
as the details of our correspondences so
as well as notifications to me to be
able to follow up with that person so if
i don't develop that relationship for
like three to six months i will actually
have notifications that will come back
and be like hey contact this person
because this person you have to talk to
this person and sometimes this is good
just you get a lot of repeat business
that way
so
crm is a great way to control users but
doesn't work at scale if you're building
a brand because there will be too many
and it won't be a you can't if your
customers are people who buy your
products or services or support you via
something like content creation you will
not be able to
keep up with the crm because let's say
like for me
um i don't know we have like something
like 500 patrons
and
some hundreds of thousands of people
that follow me over various different
platforms so there's no way i can like
keep uh a client base through direct
client though i do have direct client
right for all kinds of relationships
sponsors things like that anybody that
kind of like
goes through that so what do you do if
you don't have uh if you if you can't
use direct client or you need a better
system
the next best one is email and
newsletter
so email is incredible um and i i think
email is so good
you still can get like 70-90 open rates
on email today
and email has just stayed as consistent
as
one of the most effective and best ways
to
manage user bases you control the user
and you know the user because you can
you can get a lot of data full name
and details and signups and email so you
have direct contact to that user both
personally and at
at scale and you could and the calls to
action to those emails are really
successful so you want to sign up for a
service like mailchimp
break down your email list
and then based on data that you get from
other places so for example
you
can use a service like shopify if you're
a product-based company
and through shopify
you can you'll send out let's say like a
newsletter blast to 5 000 people
advertising your new product that you're
launching
then on shopify everybody that signs up
for that product you now have all that
data from shopify which is immense data
right it's like direct demographics it's
where they click through where they left
the website
you could take a list of your top 200
buyers for example
and you could
send a special message to every one of
those people or a special gift so for
example at counter logic gaming as a
previous company i ran
we would every year we would take our
top 50 to 100
spenders on our store and then we would
send them autographed cards from
our lcs team our players
and that would be like just like a
really huge thing right so you could do
things like that with that kind of data
and you can kind of immediately see how
your control of that user and when i say
control of the user i don't want that to
be connotated negatively
what i mean is like control is good
right because the the more control you
have the better relationship you can
have with your customer and those
customers were really happy to get that
example that i used before with clg the
that's that's like great right like
imagine that you spent a bunch of money
on a store and you spent it because you
just wanted to spend it you you were you
were just excited about that team or
whatever and then completely
without prompting you get a signed card
from like your favorite player
that's awesome right this is a really
cool thing so control is good it's not
like a negative thing to be in control
of your users really or to have control
over knowing your users the more you
know your users the better
so email newsletter is really fantastic
another option is for direct support
is patreon like services so this is the
one that i personally prefer
because you both know your user and you
could contact them directly so i can
contact every single person that's in my
believer tier for example at a hundred
dollars
and give them special options and i i
intend to right like that's one of the
things that we're implementing pretty
soon is i'm always trying to up the
paper the services on patreon is uh just
like a free call about whatever you want
after a certain number of months
probably three or four months because
you have call every three or four months
with me whatever you want if you want to
use it right because just supporting a
very high level that i appreciate that i
want to help out with and that comes
in at under the consulting cost that i
would normally have and also like
there's not like a six month eight month
wait for whatever the hell my consulting
thing is now so patreon like services
are great because you have the email you
have full name you can directly message
the user and you can give updates um and
and update notifications actually work
through email so you can send
effectively you have a newsletter as
well so you can send
patreon updates that will go directly to
a person's email that they are likely to
see because they are paying to support
you right so
patreon is a phenomenal service it's not
viable for all businesses though like if
you're a product-based business you
can't maintain your people through
patreon and you should maintain your
people through email and newsletter
and
if you are a service-based business same
thing um although you might be surprised
what businesses could
could actually run a patreon
so i actually think that a lot of like
brick and mortar retail type stores or
people that are selling product
that also want to have like an
outward-facing brand component could
actually run a patreon i think a lot of
esports teams could run it i think a lot
of
just it's kind of like they're not
thinking about it but certainly every
content creator ever could run one a lot
of people don't think about this though
but yeah you might be surprised like
thinking about okay like would this be a
viable vertical for me to um to run
if you really think it through it might
actually be the case that patreon is
good for that so think about that
but email newsletter with combined with
direct relationship with client is going
to apply to the vast majority of
businesses and then for the vast
majority of content creators you're
going to do user acquisition via one of
these services
and then you're going to hopefully toss
those people to an email or newsletter
so the answer to the question in the
mastermind of okay i've got a bunch of
ua coming in from tiktok
how and where do i send these users
the answer to that is
you do short form video where you like
point at the end and it pops up on tick
tock there's a method right now where
you can create a playlist the playlist
has
because you can't link off platform the
playlist can be a link and then the link
is sent to
the
the people copy and paste the link they
can put into a web browser or whatever
so you would send
i depends on your business
if you're a content creator
it would be more reliable to send those
to a place where you have ideal control
if you wanted to really optimize this
you would
create a web page
and then you would send you would have a
direct link that's like all of your
media on that web page like a link tree
and you would send them there and get
them to sign up for an email address so
it wouldn't be a link to it it'd be like
a link tree and you would get you'd get
like a little pop-up notification email
and there's apis that'll build this out
for you like in mailchimp and things
like that that'd be the most intelligent
thing to do is to direct those people to
a place like
um
your email newsletter
realistically
you might just want to upgrade them one
step to another a better platform so
like the step up from tick tock would be
like youtube the step up from
you could also like put them to twitch
but like
a lot of people are going to be tempted
to do this like if you're streaming tick
tock live and you wanna you're gonna be
you're gonna be tempted to go to bring
these users to twitch you actually
aren't doing any better by sending them
to twitch
you're you're not actually doing any
better at all or twitter or anything
like that so sending them to youtube is
a little bit better but still bad
sending getting them into the funnel of
a email newsletter where you send out
something
every
week two weeks three weeks or a month
depends on your cadence and kind of what
you're doing about what you're doing and
where to find you
is the best option for long-term
customer acquisition and then
at some point
you have enough
live users or subscribers who have
followed you through that email so that
email would list like here's my youtube
here's my tech talk here's my twitter
you'd have most of those users because
they're dedicated users now they've
followed you via email they're getting
updates from you they're interested in
something you're providing would follow
you on most of those platforms you'll
reach a critical mass and then you'll
start to get user acquisition from the
other platforms so youtube twitch places
like that will start to acquire your
users because you'll have a high enough
threshold to actually be able to acquire
them
so the actual answer is that you point
those people
towards email or if you are two ways to
do that which i suspect most content
creators will be you point them towards
youtube and then you say subscribe here
and
but but i i can't stress enough the
importance of
having users on email and having users
on direct support services so you could
also one step is you could do is you
could convert that user to a paid user
so if you're a tick tock broadcaster for
example or a reddit broadcaster you
could drive those users to a patreon
and you could have a very low entry fee
if you're a small like a dollar and you
can provide services there now again
that kind of depends on the type of
content you want to do
but the i guess the takeaway here is
don't mix up user acquisition with
customer
uh the cust customer how we call this i
get i guess retaining customers
you you your user acquisition is going
to be a separate strategy but the
customers that you have that you
monetize and that you can rely on are
not going to be people that you should
keep on on a platform like the
aforementioned ones
because if you did
you would
have far less
engagement
um with that user over time and it
wouldn't be worth the roi and you
basically just be giving these platforms
press right
so
the idea is think through your strategy
of user acquisition and we have videos
about that but then quite separately
think about this strategy of okay well
where does my user actually live and why
and base it on the variables a how much
control do i have over that user and b
how much do i know about that user now
so i haven't mentioned every platform in
the world on this video but i've given
you a framework to apply it to every
platform in the world so those are those
are the indicators that you should use
to be able to say okay how much do i
control this user you could be thinking
about a platform that i'm not thinking
about like linkedin for example where
you might control a lot about the user
and know a lot about the user because if
you do linkedin for example just like
coming up with that right now you know
the name of that user you know where
they work you know a bunch of stuff
about their demographics and you
someone's hands you can message them
directly as well if they follow you uh
so that's that's an option right that's
a really competitive option so the
options i've given you today are by no
means an exhaustive list of the things
that you can do to acquire users and
have them retain but it's a framework of
thinking that it's important to be able
to
actually utilize those users down the
road whether you want them for paid
opportunities or you just want to be
closer to them so there are other
opportunities like discord for example
or discord is is pretty good because you
know yours a little bit better and you
can control them a lot better but you
still are kind of several steps removed
in that
you can directly message that user but
like it's not a very good categorization
system of users like you can't very
easily see a list of of users or how
dedicated they are that versus something
like patreon where you can see exactly
if you have five users in the one dollar
tier and 10 users in the five dollars
here right you you know a lot more about
that and what those users are spending
and what benefits they're getting so
categorization of users is important as
well
the way that so that's the three factors
right is how will you know that your
user how well you can control your
relationship with that user and then
thirdly how that user is presented to
you in a data format and the data that
is provided to to you about that user so
so do you like on twitch for example
sure you can theoretically see a list of
all of your followers but it's useless
there's absolutely nothing you can do
with that whereas on a newsletter you
can see a list of names people that have
bought from you before via linking
through shopify
people that have clicked through open
rates
a lot of data right so that's that's
really way more useful and you can see
that all on mailchimp and just like one
place and shopify is an incredible place
for example too if you're doing product
that's why so many people use shopify
you could see
everybody who's bought from you when
they bought how much money the average
sale was on and on right and so you both
on a macro and micro level you can get a
lot of data
some other services like youtube uh less
so you get a lot of macro data very
little micro data on individual users
right so you have to evaluate all these
things and based on that you can
probably figure out where your user
wants to live and where you want your
user to live and then you should direct
all people to that right and then
basically ignore
everything else except for user
acquisition now you can have those
platforms right so as a business you can
have a twitter and instagram a um
a tick tock right but you are going to
have one place that those people ought
live that you're going to be goal set to
be able to point those people to and
you're going to have only a couple of
places that you want to use for actual
user acquisition the rest of them are
you're just going to kind of either
syndicate content or sort of paid lip
service to having it and just so that
you can be more exposed cool okay so
that's something to do around frameworks
around users and user retention and i
hope it helps let me know bye
