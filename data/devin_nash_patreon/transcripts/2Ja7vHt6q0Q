okay do you want to move to their voice
chat yeah let's go
oh no
everyone's in here now what happened
hello
wait what happened
nothing looks good
is it
i mean it's good only only you only you
vips uh community else can talk right
now um
if you want someone to be able to chime
in and speak you can just give them a
sanctioned role or something yeah
um let me find the link to this video
real quick and then i think we'll be
done thank you for doing this by the way
really appreciate it
um
this should be the live stream it should
be here
uh le mastermind guys let me know if
that works
um
and now it should be ultra latency
free
okay i'm then going to
wait this is not live
uh-oh
this is the last vod
yeah
this is the old link
from the previous but why
oh no
i mean why because it's the same link
[Laughter]
um
how about that one
what do you mean why it's the same leg
this is live
okay is it ultra low latency
did i get first
first what
comment
uh
there are no comments oh you did
yeah yes yeah you did yeah
the first comment ever i think this is
like actual dog [ __ ] quality
[Laughter]
it's like
it looks fine for me it's like it looks
like
1920s okay livestream on youtube
it's just like a little bit ray kind of
is it
i think so why would that be
because it's ultra low latency
so yeah but it looks like
like
dog [ __ ] like it looks so bad
doesn't it look bad to you
no
it looks fine let me show you what i'm
seeing
i think
it's like a stream for
well because you're not watching like
the actual from the actual link
that's just like your little preview
thing
which i guess is low quality for some
reason i don't know probably to save
bandwidth
yeah i assumed that was the stream
if you look on the actual link it's good
it's good okay um all right let's see
that's a
a deer creation and
i maxed the bit rate for this channel by
the way it's a 384 kilobits a second so
you should be getting silky smooth audio
cool okay thank you
why is it on youtube
oh i should link the video too
oh my god uh
it actually the hardest thing about
youtube streaming is finding the [ __ ]
link to your own video
it's like everything else is the same
but like actually finding the link to
your [ __ ] stream is impossible it's
like holy [ __ ] okay uh i think i can
just add everyone in supporter chat and
that makes sense
and they won't get mad because well wait
they might get mad but ah [ __ ] it
yeah that'll just ping everybody with
access to that channel yeah which is
fine because most of the people that
are here want to be
yeah it doesn't yeah it doesn't doesn't
annoy
them okay here we go
blap
okay i'm back okay sorry i didn't go yet
i was just
figuring it out i'll go now okay one
second
oh there's a lot of people that showed
up for this actually that's kind of cool
okay
um
are you here jeremy
would it be productive for me to go over
very quickly my incredibly shitty
idea creation process so that you can
then dismantle it
um
morning if you want i'm probably not
gonna
[Music]
do anything based on yours i'm just
gonna like give you mine
okay so we should just start there
i i guess yeah do you want to do intros
sure
um
well i think a lot of the people in this
discord probably know me already
um
but for those of you guys who don't know
me i'm jeremy i'm the owner and founder
of gaming curios
currently we run about 16 active youtube
channels i also have um actually now i
have eight silver play buttons from
youtube
i've been on youtube for about 10 years
making videos
um i don't know
anything to that i i i
believe that jeremy is
essentially the premier content creator
on youtube but there's like he's in a
small list of people
that i and i mean like small by like sub
50 people out of the
hundreds and hundreds of thousands of
people on youtube that i i think not
only
um
puts his work into practice but also
dramatically understands the process for
me like the most exciting people are the
people that like
really think about the process and why
it works instead of just like in
addition to executing in a really
incredible way right so that's one of
the reasons why i appreciate jeremy on a
professional level he's also a very dear
friend just on a personal level as well
thanks
yeah man it's uh
actually i'm very excited to do this
because i was thinking about it a lot
because i
well not recently but maybe like a month
or two ago i was kind of thinking about
like just practicing video ideas yeah
like practicing the brainstorming
process and i was kind of thinking about
like ways i could do that and i was like
oh i could do
i could i bet i could brainstorm ideas
for devon really really well but then at
that time you weren't making any videos
that'd be fun but you know he's not
making any videos so i don't want to do
it it's going to be like kind of just
wasted
like has to be at least like meaningful
practice for me i think to be effective
but um
yeah so i so i ran into this so to give
context to everybody that's like because
not everybody will know what's going on
right now so we were in mastermind chat
and we're just talking i think about
some content creation topic because i
just posted a patreon video and uh
i i was telling jeremy that my biggest
vulnerability right now like as a
creator is i'm having a oh so
for a long time i i was just having like
production problems and um like getting
in front of the camera and like like
making videos and like i got past that
and now where i'm at is
i essentially have the capacity to
create a video every day and if i had
like an idea for it and i knew it would
work on youtube in the context of what i
do i could script it i could create it
like that whole process is done and
maybe there's like more talk later on to
be
to talk about like
like how that works and like how that
process works because i figured that
part out but now the part i have is like
okay i just can't think of things that
work i don't know why they would work
and like i'm continuously able to create
patreon videos it's a perfect example i
make them almost every day because i
have no concern whatsoever about like
the marketing and like how
those videos get produced but the the
videos for youtube i i always think will
not go to market they won't be
successful um
and
so i i i first was like
i should hire a domain expert which is
like somebody that can maybe like do
research like figure out like what would
work and why and then jeremy's like well
i can probably get a hundred ideas for
you in like 20 minutes and then i had
like like half a dozen would be viable
and i'm like okay well let's just talk
about that see to solve the whole
problem so that's where we're at that's
that's now we're right okay
yeah so i don't know if you're like
fully ready for me to get started
because when i get started it's gonna be
a lot of it's probably just gonna be
like me talking the whole time okay and
probably
i or i should say maybe ideally like not
so much interrupting okay
um
so i can't share my camera but i think i
can
share my
screen which is definitely more than
enough
um
let me set that up
okay and then i'll put you uh
on here real quick
let me see
you guys like my background oh that's so
cool that's sick
i took this photo myself it's kind of
stretched out so it looks a little
scuffed but there's a little cat in it
kind of cute i guess give me two seconds
to like throw this on
the livestream section and i just need
to like find a way to
use obs to intelligently copy this over
hang on
here i have
the devon's greatest friend actually the
older brother i don't know if you've
ever used this before but have you do
you know of this
notepad program i use devin it's called
notepad plus plus we don't speak of this
inferior technology okay like inferior
what are you talking about here superior
way you're uh
blasphemy
imagine being able to save a file okay
like what the [ __ ] is this all right
the [ __ ] is this freaking like you're
like the people that brought guns to
japan
okay the the art of the sword was more
elegant
hang on you don't want it
what's that
okay
that's your fault i guess
reset transform
uh
okay here
here
uh
i'll be taking notes sorry so once i set
this up i can we don't ever have to do
anything again uh let's see
transition okay i think we're good to go
um
i've got you like in a big corner of the
screen and then
yeah and i've got my notepad so i'm
ready to just like listen take notes and
yeah okay cool
so
um probably the best place for me to
start
is that
it's just with my overall process
i'm very
quantity focused
basically the way my process works is i
just try to come up with literally every
single tiny crappy idea i can possibly
think of
and then from
there i will
narrow that down into videos that i
actually want to make
um
which is why i say like oh i can
probably come up with like 100 ideas in
an hour because that's kind of how my
process works like i just come up with a
huge quantity
and then from there
figure out
the actual like quality ones that i want
to do
so if we're looking at something like
devin's channel
generally the way i start is i want to
try to look at like the categories of
the content that i'm making on a certain
channel
and then
for categories specifically try to
narrow down and come up with unique
ideas
from there
um so if we're going to look at
something like devin's channel
we take a look at categories he's got
quite a few categories of content
actually
um
i would say let's see how much we can
organize so we've probably got he's got
like streaming
meta content
um
business marketing for content creators
he's also got some like self-improvement
content but that's like not as
prominent
let's see what other stuff he's got so
like streaming news
information
um it's also more like guide info
content
i guess these categories are a little
bit similar to one another but for the
most part i think that
the ideas i want to come up with can
probably fit into all this
financial is a big one
i think financial yeah particularly
because it's high cpm on youtube too
all right i'll put that in here because
i think that falls into that okay
um
yeah so let's start with these
categories for now we could always add
more
i'm trying to think actually do i want
to add more for someone like devin
that's probably fine
okay
um
[Music]
so
now we want to think about
the categories individually
and actually try to come up with ideas
based on the specific categories and
what he can talk about
especially want to think about like what
devin can provide what kind of
information he knows things that would
be interesting
so
that's going to come down to a lot of
just
videos about
um
information
and we have quite a few ways to come up
with stuff like that
for now i'm just gonna go with stuff off
the top of my head
and also stuff based on like stuff he's
already done
so one thing i always want to do with
the channel is like you want to kind of
look at
stuff that you've done in the past that
was really successful
and
see if you can kind of expand on that do
more episodes of that it's like a very
kind of basic starting point
so right of the way one of the one of
the ideas that i thought you should
really make
is
uh okay i'm just gonna come up i'm just
gonna organize it like this
well one of the ideas that i thought was
really good that he should make is
another video about viewbotting
um
again i'm not really going to actually
think about these ideas i'm not going to
expand on them i'm just going to try to
come up with literally every single idea
that i can possibly think of
um
so the the actually thinking about the
ideas is kind of what you do afterwards
once this is all done but for now you
just want to like fully spew your brain
onto the notepad
and just see how much you can really
come up with so we got like
um
so probably the second episode of being
a twitch affiliate
um video about streamers making you
already kind of made that
i think this is an idea he already has
planned
um but i also want to talk about some
categories that i kind of had ideas from
so in terms of like streaming meta
content you want to think about like
okay what does that mean
we've got
youtube streaming
we've got facebook streaming i think
could be really interesting it's a video
talking about facebook streaming
and growing on facebook
we've also got something that i think is
really interesting which is streaming on
reddit which actually nobody knows about
but is actually very very interesting
insane thousands of viewers
i think that could be super super cool
for other streaming meta content
you've made a lot of videos about just
like the platform wars and
um
various different platforms so i'm
trying to think like how could you
kind of talk about that i think you
could probably do a lot of videos about
facebook streaming
at least one video about reddit
streaming
um
you can make a video about
why you should not stream
as far as like news and information
goes um
i think where do i want to go next with
this
okay so i'm having trouble thinking of
something off the top of my head so what
we're going to do is we're going to look
at other channels
in a similar niche and just kind of like
see what they're doing
um
what other channels are there on this
niche
so i have a list of ones i try to do
when i'm inspired um
so i look at esports talk belly or news
graham stefan
asman gold because it's often meta
topics
our twitch
yeah i know biller okay i'm gonna stick
just these two for now
just because i need to get my brain
working a little bit
um
okay so you got just some news people
joining teams
i think making a video about dr
disrespect could be kind of interesting
actually
like his band and just
in general
uh which leads me to think that push a
video about which bands i think could be
pretty interesting
and now i'm i'm of the opinion because i
actually kind of thought about making a
video like this but realistically i
probably never will
um
and that is a video about like why all
twitch bands are stupid
and essentially i just think that
temporary bands are something that like
never makes sense to do on a platform
and you should pretty much
never do like a temporary band just
doesn't really make any sense at all
i think it just both doesn't accomplish
what it wants to do which is punish the
person and then
um it's also like so pointless like i
think youtube's ban system is so vastly
superior where they just basically never
ever temporary ban
and if you get three strikes you just
get permabanned
um that could be kind of interesting
got some more esports so you moused over
that 99k because you were thinking that
could be a possible interesting topic
because that's that's related to twitch
suing for dmc
it is because um i think it's really
interesting that they sued two people
which isn't a lot and most people like
had kind of a negative reaction to that
but the real reaction the real thing
like the twitch did was like
we're actually taking steps to show that
we're doing something which i think has
like a lot of implications yeah all
right
um
as far as okay streaming news and
information i can do this one pretty
well we've got like future updates
stream platforms
you kind of touched on it a lot with the
video about like the future of live
streaming but i do think talking about
like future stuff in general is like
pretty exciting especially when it's
someone of like your authority
who
[Music]
um perceive you to have like some level
of information that most people probably
don't
whether that's true or not
it probably is true in most cases but uh
yeah
uh let me see
i have some notes here that i can go off
of as well
kind of just want to get my brain
working a little bit really get myself
thinking about it
um okay let's move so i'm gonna be all
over the place it's kind of just what i
always do yeah let's do some guide info
content so
how long does it take to grow a twitch
stream
kind of interesting
um
you could do like exactly how
to grow a twitch stream
and give people like the step-by-step
blueprint of like start the youtube
channel
uh you know grow on youtube and and like
promote your twitch from youtube and
like the whole process of that
um
let's see
i think you talked a lot more about like
monetizing effectively
um
so you can make like how to make 100k
per month with a thousand viewers on
twitch
why twitch doesn't want you to grow
i think could also be really interesting
because i don't think twitches has any
incentive to actually grow new creators
over people that are
overgrowing like actual existing
people yeah
um you could do some just like rapid
fire list stuff like 25
important tips for any streamer
things to not do is always a good one
and i can do a better title than that
a lot of these probably aren't that
unique or that good
but you got to start somewhere right
yeah
10 ways to make
10k a month
just like ideas for people where to
stream
i'm just gonna keep going honestly
until i can't come up with anything
this was one i thought would be kind of
fun
secret income sources that people don't
know about because there's actually
quite a lot
um okay i can't think of a good title
but i want to make like a video about
how to improve your content
that would definitely be very useful
probably no one would care about it
because people are stupid but
that would probably be like the most
actual useful video you can make for
helping streamers
oh yeah here's a fun one um you have
this like
these uh
this title from this guy on youtube
called adam ragusia
love this guy i'm sure you probably know
him i don't um but he has this like
really hilarious title style that people
like meme super hard where it's like why
i season my cutting board not my steak
they've got like why i
don't stream on
as a twitch
streamer
or like why
i
[Music]
it's a phenomenal title
um
why you shouldn't stream if you want to
stream
side note or is it interrupting
it's okay yeah there's
there's so many um times where i like i
think meme titles are like way better
than like seo titles
uh i guess you could do 2022.
so you could do like speculate
um you know because because why you
don't you know the this is the the us
politics approach you know like why why
use facts when you can just make [ __ ] up
right that's that's
yeah so uh
works pretty well i think
um
oh here's an eye here's a video that i
think would be really interesting
how to make money on twitch without
streaming
because i'm sure it's definitely
possible basically just doing businesses
that don't involve streaming
or i guess something like i do is
technically possible
um how to find under saturated markets
on twitch because i do think there are
probably a lot
when people get so caught up in
streaming the biggest categories when
you can actually grow to like a couple
hundred viewers pretty easily if you
just stream on a category that's
undersaturated
um
oh here's a good one
um
this falls into
i don't know i guess this category
why blank
blew up on twitch um
so you could go
through you could basically just go
through hand by hand through all the big
streamers like xqc and just be like why
xqc blew up on twitch
and like fully analyze it
um
okay number x
from sources
and just try to come up with like
everything possible so you probably do
like
20 plus for more than that honestly
the only equipment you need stream on
twitch
or just to stream
uh the kicker is that you don't need
anything it's nothing
because you don't need equipment
um
why some streamers make 10 times more
with the same views
you could probably make a lot of videos
about just monetization
um i want to put this one a little bit
lower i'll come back to it
business marketing and self-improvement
is probably
a little bit more difficult for me to
come up with just because
i
am not thinking about it as much i guess
um
okay let's see
kind of similar to another one but
whatever doesn't matter you don't worry
about it you just keep going
um
and i'm kind of not really categorizing
these properly now but it doesn't matter
okay let me think
i haven't even gone to like actually
looking at
other channels yet this is just off the
top of my head so far
i'll save this for later
because i'm going to come back to that
um
you do like a small stream income guide
that could be kind of cool i think
um
[Music]
okay so a lot of these have just been
kind of guides a lot of how-to's
um i guess there's kind of other stuff
that you could do but i want to keep it
within videos that are like actually
possible for you to make
usually i would also think about like
experiments and challenges and like we
talk about like how to's and what
happens whens
so i've done a lot of how-to's but i
haven't really done any what happens
whens
so but at the same time i don't really
feel like you would want to make videos
like that because
because
it just was like too much effort for you
it's not really your content style
can you give me an example of one of
those videos
yeah sure so for example you would do
like
um
it would just be kind of like
experiments around like growing twitch
like what happens if you buy 10 000
twitch followers
what happens like i hired a guy on
fiverr to promote my twitch channel and
this is what happened like stuff like
that those are kind of awesome actually
i like those
yeah okay
i can't actually write them
oh i guess it falls into this category
i know you're not going to do these
though because
you would have to actually stream to do
those so
it's not going to happen
true
i don't know why i typed that in all
caps but whatever i did
um
oh here's some other videos you could do
that'll be kind of fun
um
you could talk about stuff like taxes
and
stuff outside of
just actually streaming so for example
one video that i thought was really cool
make a video explaining tax write-offs
um
well
okay but this is a better title
you don't want to call it a video about
taxes because no one's actually going to
watch it yeah um so for example you can
you can spice it up a little bit more
right so you can do like how to buy the
gucci belt for 200
or you have to grab the famous graham
711 which is
how i bought a tesla for
78 a month
not this exactly though but something
similar to it
what was he just using tax strategies or
business write-offs in that is that how
he did yeah okay
probably more videos about actually
improving content i think are probably
good
um
i'm just gonna keep going honestly like
i'm gonna stick to these categories i
think i probably won't actually do
anything for these other categories
maybe just because i feel like it's so
disconnected from what i'm thinking
about right now
um
all right let's go back
to some of my other notes
okay
so that's i think everything i can come
up with just the top of my head
for now
um
i want to go back to
devin's channel
start thinking about stuff he's done
before
what you can do
new stuff of maybe
a lot of guide stuff
i like this kind of console you could
probably do something an updated version
of that holy [ __ ] i can't believe that
has 120 that's a long so many of my
videos are long tail
like they just like that video like
sucked ass forever
that was a great video i saw it
um
i'm gonna do a bunch of truth videos
because that's a cool series you got
hey this is my video
where's mine it's somewhere here you
have a couple oh yeah it's here that's
always scary
okay
um
i think you could do a lot of videos
about big streamers and like why
big streamers are so successful and do
kind of like case studies instead of
doing interviews you do it as more of
like a case study
um i'm just going to call it the truth
because
i don't know
probably you could come up with a better
title than that
why ex-streamer is the most successful
streamer of all time et cetera you'd
want to do a title specifically for
for each streamer
but i'm not coming up with titles so i'm
just coming up with ideas
i think doing videos about the minecraft
streamers would be really good
for
oh biggest streamers
probably doing like amaranth or whoever
the biggest girl streamers would be
really cool
uh there's minecraft
can people still see me in discord by
the way
can right yeah okay cool
and on stream
cool
all right almost watched oh this is like
nothing yeah this is like spanish people
spanish people farm dude they're busted
i mean
you got like rambu and phil's up
i just i don't want to leave it at like
too many people
for categories
um
oh you know you could do
but i think would be really good
um
the truth about gambling streams on
twitch
because most of them are made they don't
they're not even like actually gambling
they're playing with like fake money or
demo accounts right yeah
some of them are but a lot of them are
not
everybody besides train
pretty much yeah
yeah
yeah
i don't know how you'd feel about making
a video about gambling even if it's in a
negative light though but
it's up to you obviously that's what
i've been thinking about for a while
i think everything about tyler1 can be
really interesting too
just because
he's such an anomaly
of like this guy who just
plays league of legends
even though he's so ridiculously
entertaining
um
okay we can make some videos about
games as well
myself died is always actually kind of
interesting i find
um one other games died on twitch
fortnite is probably the best one to
talk about just because it's like the
most prominent even though it's like not
really dead at all people think it's
dead so that's enough to make the video
about it
um
where's the top just chatting streamers
of course it's on
my irl streaming guy that could be
interesting
i think it could be very interesting to
make a video talking about how the most
the big most big streamers don't
actually have very good content
do a stream and you have exceptional
content it's actually not that hard to
grow
if you can
um market your channel with like youtube
and stuff
um
you do something like why just chatting
is down 20 you know based on stats are
up 20
things like that
yeah
that could work um as far as like news
and information goes
this one's a little tricky because
i don't actually keep up with twitch
news anymore like at all honestly
but so i can just give you like general
categories of like videos
about big things big streamers are
dealing
and why
uh get out of streaming
i'm just gonna delete these because i
don't wanna i don't feel like coming up
with ideas for those categories sorry
devin
you'll have to do that on your own
i want to try to think about a little
bit more
complex ideas though stuff and more
along the lines of like reddit streaming
because i think that's really
interesting
i think a video
explaining the facebook streaming
algorithm could be really good
and youtube's
as well because they're so different to
twitch and it's like people think those
platforms are just stupid but it's
actually like fully intentional
there's a reason why youtube doesn't
have a stream directory yep
facebook and stuff actually i think i
mean
technically
youtube does have a streaming directory
but just nobody knows about it
gaming.youtube.com yeah
but uh nobody really uses this yeah it's
it's nobody cares
but i mean see it doesn't it does
actually exist
it does exist
you know the directory
you know youtube streaming used to be so
much crazier than it actually is or
like
um
i don't know how you would make a video
about this
but
um
basically when youtube streaming came
out it was really really crazy like
youtube had basically for a span of
about a month this was this was like
five years ago
but for a span of about a month youtube
had just like
fully deep
fisted
streams into the algorithm and there was
like 10 people streaming and they were
all getting like like there was this one
call of duty streamer that was getting
like two million concurrent viewers
what and we i remember watching like so
many random channels just like
completely blow up where we watch this
like random girl
who would
stream and she would have like 50k
viewers and her stream was like
just some dumb [ __ ] and she was like a
nobody before but then she just like
happened to stream at the right time
like right when they were blowing it up
and i think you could probably
make that into a video talking about
like
how youtube and facebook could literally
just like be bigger than twitch
overnight if they wanted to
because they can like facebook can
literally just like say okay this video
this stream gets a million views right
now yep
let's turn it off
yeah
i can just do that so
um
so you could
make a video talking about how the
viewers are quote unquote fake even
though they're not fake
i think that could be a good title
in the same vein i think it would be
really cool to make a video about like
um
it'd be kind of interesting to make a
video about
why facebook stream chat is actually so
good
and i think this would be very
controversial especially for anyone on
twitch because people hate facebook chat
but
all the problems that you talked about
in this video
don't exist on facebook yeah at all
because there's no anonymity there's no
bullying because it's like like this
guy's toast made a video about it like
some guy called some guy calls you a
piece of [ __ ] in chat it's like oh
wow that's that's very that's not nice
if you just say greg from alabama
can you opt to have a gamer name on base
on facebook or do you have to use real
names
do you know
i
don't know but almost everyone just uses
real names yeah
okay
now
is this
hold on i can't count
132 lines okay so
one two three four five six seven eight
three four
three five
six for 748 okay
132 minus 48. okay we're at 84 ideas so
far
we're actually
84 minus 83
82
okay 81.
not quite 100 just yet
but has it been an hour yet that's the
real question
i don't think so i hope not
how's it been i don't know
um let me see
oh it's been like 50 minutes oh [ __ ]
okay hold on i got to speed this up 51
minutes yeah and
i don't want to look at bellio lar i'll
be giving me a like
and it's crazy how many video how many
views he gets on videos about whitman
like everything is equipment with this
guy
like i feel like equipment is literally
like such a useless
yeah
it is a streamer
but
you could probably make people obsess
about it yeah
um okay
but you could make videos and just like
talk about it
in the sense of like
you don't need to buy anything
okay so i want i don't want you to just
like copy these videos obviously so i'm
going to try to think like what could
you do that's
well it's just a lot of guide stuff i
don't know if i want to if i want to
come up with more guide ideas because i
did a lot of that already
he jacks a lot of my ideas directly that
how to really go from
[Music]
yeah
i i've never looked at his channel to
get ideas what's that i'm not saying you
can't jack his ideas i'm just saying
that i already came up with so many
ideas that are similar to his that i
don't want to come up
something some more along the lines of
just probably
you could do some pretty controversial
stuff like
jeremy trying to set
trying to destroy my agency here
yeah i guess you probably wouldn't do
ideas like that but i don't know
why you should view bot illegally on
twitch is a phenomenal title yeah
yeah i mean if it's legal why not right
yeah
you should do every
if if you're not breaking any rules like
you should do everything in your power
to grow if you're not breaking any rules
or screwing over other people
you probably make fun like five videos
about viewbotting yeah such a good topic
these are all just like stories about
people a lot of like case studies
in this
i imagine it's gonna be probably similar
with this one
doctor disrespect
jake is all news
yeah yeah i imagine this this guy's jake
right i don't know yeah sorry
um
i mean you're gonna just do like
like i can't really come up with ideas
for news because i just don't pay
attention to twitch news like i just
don't so
those are always really straightforward
videos when they come out like
everyone's gonna know yeah
you could probably make videos about
like why specific streamers died on
twitch it could be kind of interesting
you could probably make a video about
why dream died on twitch but i don't
think that would
necessarily be received very well
i mean it would literally just be oh
because he doesn't stream
he didn't actually not even
yeah
but you could do it about like some
other people that are older or maybe
quit
that could be kind of interesting
why new streamers are quitting
okay
are we at an hour yet i still got like
five minutes right
um
yeah
okay
let's let's look more at sully gnome
that's um
kind of interesting here i think
lots fortnite
definitely
this is a new game
um
well here's probably an interesting
thing nice to look the most the fastest
growing streamers
90 days
okay xqc whenever
so you could do case studies about like
these people
why this person's the fastest oh this
guy gained a million followers and he
didn't stream
that's interesting that is interesting
you can do you could call it
the quote unquote fastest
but then it's a video about follower
bots and and how followers don't really
matter that much
uh okay let's just close it out with
some easy ones maybe
we need to do
just like youtube and stuff
okay
are we at 100 maybe i think so
i want to actually get to 100 because
that's what i said i would
so one two three
forty one
oh we're like five
okay short gotta be five quick five
quick ones real quick ones
um
more videos about small streamers maybe
because people love videos about small
streamers
because everyone's a small streamer
pretty much
five quick ones real quick once oh my
god i got like two minutes left i think
actually i think i'm two minutes over
but it's fine
um
you have 30 seconds
okay
and
boom time
record
yeah
okay so it's insane
no i know you might be thinking hours
kind of a meme here but
i think
when you're doing
idea planning
it's really really good to put yourself
in a deadline constraint
because it just really gets you to focus
and like think a lot more actively
about
the the
whole situation
really gets your brain to like
just put stuff out there a lot
um yeah so that's why i wanted to do it
in one hour
um but yeah this is my idealist what do
you think i think probably 90 of these
ideas are trash
but that's usually how it goes there's
definitely like quite a few ideas here
that are like really good like i would
love to see a video about reddit
streaming yeah because just nobody knows
about it and it's actually really good
even though it's really hard to do
um i i watch one guy who streams on
reddit his name's ryoukar
maybe you know him and people don't
though i guess
but uh
this guy actually just got married like
last week but he streams mario
and oh i kind of ran over
yeah yeah i love this guy he's actually
one of my favorite creators just because
i love watching mario it's like so fun
to watch
um
but what he does is he basically will
dual stream
and he'll stream on youtube and reddit
at the same time or youtube and twitch
and the whole time on reddit he's just
like hey guys go check out my stream on
youtube uh
um and on r he gets way more views on
reddit he gets like 8k views on reddit
yeah
which drives to his youtube channel
pretty much everyone gets 8k views on
reddit because no saturation
is yeah like the streaming there is very
limited like not you're not allowed to
like just stream on reddit
you have to like go through some kind of
process and then you only you're only
allowed to stream like 30 minutes
something like that
um i think a video about facebook could
be really cool too
what's up about facebook video about
twitch bands
a lot of videos about viewbotting could
be really good
um
you do
uh some case studies could be kind of
interesting i think case studies about
like gambling streams would be a lot
more interesting like meta stuff
rather than like specific people just
because specific people is like well
it's great but it's like kind of
overdone
um a lot of like futures i think you
could also do a lot of value with like
talking about feature updates to twitch
future things um yeah i mean maybe like
20 of these ideas are all right which is
actually pretty good consider it so that
if assuming 20 of these ideas are decent
that's like
yeah a month of ideas in an hour
right there
i have many questions
all right
yeah this is phenomenal thank you
so thank you sincerely
oh yeah it's my pleasure it was fun
how do you think i did
okay
so
one so a couple of um a couple of things
that i
have been thinking about because i've
been writing down questions as we go
through this
the the first thing is that um
many of these
i just want your thoughts on this many
many of these ideas like the vast
majority required me to repackage
content right so
yeah what are your thoughts on that
um it's not something you want to do too
much
like
you don't want to repackage content for
like every video but i think you could
definitely repackage content a lot more
than you would think like
your favorite finance creator um graham
yeah
literally like 90 of his videos are
repackaged now because he like run out
of stuff to talk about
like this video how much you need to
invest by every age um
i wonder how many times he's done this
how much you need to invest by every age
how much you need to save by every age
how to invest in your twenties like yeah
he's literally making this video like
ten times
but that's fine because
it still reaches new people and
especially with stuff like this i think
you need to hear the information more
than once sometimes yeah
you know so it just kind of depends on
like if the topic is good enough i think
you can definitely repackage it like i
think
you could be doing a lot of videos that
are simply just like
second episodes to your best performers
um and it might not it probably isn't
gonna do as well as like the original
video but like
if it gets like only 200k views instead
of 500k that's still really good for you
i imagine right sometimes um i'm really
confused like for example the seven
success secrets video that i came out
with i expected to do very well
algorithmically uh and it's like the
worst performing video of the past 10.
well this is like a guide video right so
like guides are probably not going to do
super well right away but they'll
definitely understand well over time
yeah it's so weird how that works it's
so weird
just because it's like no it's it's it's
not weird at all it's because people
don't really like clicking on guides but
then over time they will
eventually
people will eventually over time people
are going to want to watch guides more
than like some kind of meta video or
something like a news or one-off thing
because this guy like guide content
lasts forever basically right
whereas most of the other content
probably doesn't
um but it's just like a lot less
marketable and a lot less interesting
you gotta like if you want guide content
to do really well you got to like really
clickbait it like way harder
like
much harder than this like seven things
top streamers do that you don't that's
like the basic test that i go with a lot
of times
it's probably better than this i guess
i feel like this title is too
professional
this one specifically seven success
secrets to become a top 1 streamer
you need something that appeals to like
the normies that have like five iq yeah
oh yeah
the most successful titles i've been
having are like really
like 39 daft like like gen z like small
streamer syndrome is a really good
example like it doesn't have any
i mean even just kind of like this like
future of live streaming yeah that
worked too well for what it is i don't
understand
that's well this i think specifically is
just like it's such an interesting topic
and the it kind of markets itself in a
way but
just this content framing was really
solid i think
okay um what are your other questions
so
um
the other thing that i worry about is
that essentially all of these topics
take me in the like literally all of
them take me in the direction of like
a
twitch guru right
that that like educates people or stays
within the streaming space and that is a
um
a huge vulnerability to create a channel
around i think so like in in the same
way that
what
like
like so
for me i'm basing these topics based on
what i think will perform best not based
on what you want to make interesting
okay um because i think as you noticed
like i totally just cut out the business
marketing and like self-development
content yeah
because i just i don't know i didn't
really have inspiration for it i guess
but i also thought that like well videos
about streaming are what does the best
for you so i'm gonna focus on that
um but i know you're you're up you're
not necessarily optimizing for that i'm
not saying like you can't do ideas that
i didn't that aren't on this list or
something like that like
you definitely can continue to do like a
variety of topics and like other stuff
like that um
but i mean i would say you've probably
like grown as sort of like a twitch guru
like and that is a big part of your
brand like not necessarily being a
twitch streamer but more like
yeah i run a twitch agency like i've
been on streaming like
like you've st you've already
established yourself as this really big
authority on twitch streaming
whether that's through like honestly
that's probably in a lot of ways just
through the trainwrecks podcast
as well as just like how you present
yourself
so i just thought like oh this is the
probably the content that would
the kind of content
that you could do if you wanted to just
like maximize views
so another way to state that question
would be let's say that i want to
move
horizontally which which means to me
means like i'm posting videos about
this kind of stuff but then like maybe
one in five or one and three i'm posting
like
uh a finance or esports video or or
gaming industry or meta video would you
repeat this process and just say okay
for an hour i'm gonna think about
esports and then just write every
esports idea you possibly can for now
i'm gonna think about finance right
every finance idea you can going off of
channels is that would that be your
methodology for expanding through those
categories
yeah probably okay um
so so
i definitely focus very much on twitch
during this whole that's fine i'm just
what i'm trying to do is like like for
for the creative process i'm trying to
figure out okay like next month if i'm
like okay i i just do not feel like i'm
creating enough videos around like
financial education or something i'm
interested in so the the strategy is
you bust out a notepad you you set us
you set a amount of time and then
you literally brainstorm regardless of
how shitty those ideas are as much as
you can within those categories
yeah okay so then i think about the
categories and then four ideas
specifically
most of what i did during this session
was just ideas off the top of my head
but a lot of what i'll do is looking at
past successes
um looking at similar channels from the
same niche
but usually i also do what i do a lot of
is looking at similar channels and other
niches
which works really well for gaming but i
don't know how well it works for like
non-gaming because i don't know what
kind of niche you could look at like if
you could look at like a tech channel
and come up with ideas for this kind of
stuff i don't know if you could do that
uh but that's usually what i do a lot of
and then just like scroll through my
other channels just like try to think of
other people like
the stuff other people's doing with
gaming it's really easy to just like
with gaming honestly a lot of my
a lot of my brainstorming sessions are
just looking at channels other channels
why don't you outsource idea creation
at all
or or do you consider your outsourcing
by the education a little bit but i do
outdoor idea creation on channels that
are
fully outsourced yes i was about to say
like managers yeah people that yeah
but i take care of it for new channels
generally because for a couple reasons
um
the first reason is that i kind of just
enjoy it and it also doesn't take that
much time like
i enjoy it i'm good at it it's not like
it takes me a week
you know i can i can do ideas for a
month for a new channel in a day very
easily
if you if you couldn't would you
outsource it like do you have any like
spiritual what i'm asking is basically
do you have any kind of like spiritual
disagreement with outsourcing ideation
for people that don't have that
competency
i
don't disagree with it
i mean i i don't
think there's anything wrong with
outsourcing it but i also think that i'm
good enough at it to where it's probably
better to just do it myself
because i don't think
i mean i i could find someone to do it
with but i think
it would be very very hard to find
someone who can do it better than me
and have it still be worth it
like because i could find someone who's
better than me but it would probably
cost like ten thousand dollars an hour
or some [ __ ] right yeah
where it's like someone who's like
already a really successful creator and
they're like very experienced etc they
know what works on youtube that kind of
thing yeah which was my a follow-up
question and that's that like
um taking some of these ideas that even
are
really good conceptually to like
title and thumbnail i guess that's just
like that's that's the job right
well like there's no there's no i mean
i don't really worry about marketing
when i come with ideas because you can
market anything like
you think so if it's good content the
marketing can can be there
i mean if it's a good content yeah
um i mean not every video is going to be
your best video ever yeah of course
and so usually what i do is i'll come up
with this idea of this huge list and i
narrow it down to like
maybe 30 of the ideas that i think would
perform the best so that's definitely
when i do that process is like that's
the next step of like okay narrow down
the ideas
and delete like almost all of them
and then keep the like 20 30 that you
think are really really good
and so that's usually like when i would
when i would um
when i would do that whole process of
like
figuring out which ones are marketable
and which ones aren't
and then
just making sure that like
to approve an idea it's like you want to
make sure it's marketable you can
actually execute on the idea well
um it's something that people would be
interested in and it would be good
content
um so that would be that's kind of like
the criteria that i would narrow it
narrow ideas down with
and then if an idea is all of those
things then you can definitely figure
out marketing for it for sure yeah they
will
that makes sense
is there anything about the ideation
process
[Music]
that
we're missing or like
um
particularly like techniques that you
might use in
researching
in this like i i was watching your
process so taking notes on it also um
like is there anything that you think
you might be leaving out
well definitely
the biggest thing that i always do a lot
of that i didn't really do today is
looking at other channels
like i study other channels really a lot
especially when i'm coming up with like
gaming ideas like
i just go look at like other channels
like have all these channels saved on my
bookmarks like okay i wonder what this
person is doing today
let's see oh this guy's getting a lot of
views that's really cool how can i do
this it's like okay what is this guy
doing okay he's making
custom mods about minecraft it's like
okay so how can i do that could i make
custom mods or is that too difficult
like sure okay i could hire a developer
let's do that what could i do that's how
can i do it differently like what could
i do this differently so okay well the
mods are just different right so let's
see maybe we could think about doing
mods that are just new well okay say you
hire a developer and you make your own
mods well then it's going to be unique
because you're making the mod yourself
most likely
so okay a lot of custom stuff custom
diamonds custom tnt custom hearts so we
could do like okay minecraft but there's
custom water yeah
minecraft but there's custom snowballs
minecraft but there's custom whatever
how many channels are you following
there like would you say
you have them categorized by bookmark
and you're looking at maybe
at least
at least two dozen yeah
well i don't i don't look at um
minecraft channels that much anymore but
this is when i was like planning
minecraft originally like you got people
to do crazy stuff like
honestly nowadays i look at minecraft so
much not for ideas for minecraft but for
ideas for other games because people do
so much crazy stuff in minecraft you can
apply it across to other games yeah
yeah
so i i spent a lot of time looking at
other channels and like trying to see
what other people do that we could do in
some way how do you find these channels
well like so let's say i want to build a
repertoire of like 30 finance channels
sure well i mean you kind of just start
from somewhere right
so you just kind of start by searching
you probably got like 10 just by
searching right
uh
finance guide i guess i don't know if
you want to find finance channels so
here you got like one and you just look
at the ones have a lot of subs maybe
yeah two
three
four five
and then it's like okay it's a lot of it
i just find through like youtube
recommendations honestly like once you
go down the rabbit hole like it starts
the system works yeah yeah like if you
want to find a lot of channels really
easily what you can do is go on youtube
on either a new account or like a
different account or like incognito
and then
um
search the category and then
search through like watch some videos of
like people you already know in the
category
and then your recommendations for that
youtube account will be adjusted
and then you can find people through it
my home page is like blocked right now
so it doesn't really work but
hopefully you get the idea i do yeah
yeah you want to do on an account where
it's like your recommendations aren't
already adjusted so it's like a fully
clean slate because it'll just toss you
things from that category then yeah
exactly yeah and um i understand the
process insanely valuable seriously like
this is awesome yeah yeah i think this
it's huge it not only like i'll i will
repeat this process over the next few
days for like
um
i i think i want to do an esports one i
think i want to do a finance one and
then like just intersperse those videos
as like because like in my case there's
a lot of types of content that i don't
care gets as much press but what's
interesting is like
the uh the best selling content like
pushes the rises the tide of those other
boats right so like it used to be that
if i made like a high-powered like
mentorship or like um business success
video like it might get up to like 5k
while everything else is performing at
like 15 to 20. but now like a
like a a meta video will push up to like
70 to 80k like the future of live
streaming and then like a like a video
that's like just interesting like high
powered like questions millionaires ask
themselves which i think is one of the
best videos you can possibly watch for
like business success is um 20k
right sure where that video a year ago
would have been four or five was this so
that's awesome to me like it doesn't
need to be a best performing video
because of his impact yeah
i think you could also still make a case
that those videos that have really
um excuse me
that those kinds of like videos that
have a really high value to the viewer
specifically
could end up making you more money
because those people could uh the people
that watch those videos could
potentially funnel into the patreon a
lot more than like someone watching some
like news video
yeah they add more direct value
that's true
yeah
yeah so i do that and
then the other thing i'm thinking of too
is like the one thing i think i might do
differently and and this
is i think i could actually
create a work back for this and then
throw it back into the lab and
like
have like people that understand this
paid per hour to like
build out these kind of lists and and
then
maybe that works maybe it doesn't but i
think there's like an amount of money to
toss at that that would be
worth doing especially with the patreon
supporting it
for sure yeah
also i have something i kind of wanted
to mention while everyone's here yeah of
course um vid summit is like next week i
just found out that it's actually in los
angeles so i decided i'm gonna go oh
um i don't know if anyone else is going
to this but
it's like this creator event it's not
really that open to the public the
tickets are a thousand dollars
uh but the speakers are really really
cool you got like mr beast like
everyone here is like multi-million
subscriber person [ __ ]
you got mr beast you got graham stefan
you got like
thera leaves like all the boys
pretty much like graham stefan ryan tran
that's cool wow um
apparently this is their eighth one i
didn't realize like one of my our
friends uh our friend our slash
went to i think the seventh one but last
year was in like it was closer to where
mr beast was on the east
coast um
this is like vidcon but good
like
all right it's not really for
yeah like what i'm saying is like it's
like uh it's like four craters yeah
i think like the only i think they only
sell like 500 tickets wow but
uh they're still on sale apparently so
yeah
that's crazy
oh but then i realized like wait it's in
los angeles it's like just down the
street for me so i'm gonna go are you
speaking
no no i literally decided today that i'm
gonna go oh i cse
i would love to speak but i'm sure it's
too late for that
maybe i could speak next year
i think he could
one of the things that surprised me is
like
how
we can have a talk about this like how
easy it is to actually become like a
speaker at like i was very early into my
career i was speaking at like south by
southwest which is like a [ __ ]
insanely like i spoke at ces right like
and it's just like
there's
so like there's so much
traditional clout attached to like if
you just come in as like ceo of gaming
curios and it's like you put up the
numbers that are like i don't know what
your total viewed channels are you know
you know what i mean though like you
combined all your channels together get
your total subscriber people just be
like what the [ __ ] and like and like
that's enough authority already to talk
at every single
like
video yeah like i'm probably bigger than
like half the people on this list yeah
um yeah because i remember looking into
that speaking of like packs and stuff
like it's so easy
to do it is actually so easy you just
have to like actually make a panel and
send it to them and then you and then
once here's the crazy thing like in
advance on time once you know the so so
there's a you know you notice how
conventions there's people that come
back every [ __ ] year
what like like literally it's the same
panel every year at twitchcon at pax
everything
and the reason that happens is because
once you do get approved for that panel
which is not that hard to do you then um
get a contact and that person would
actually like outbounds to you
to be like hey can you come to a because
that person's job is to fill those slots
so
like i still every year get requested to
speak at south by southwest every year
and i haven't spoken there in like years
and like ces same thing like
um i got reached out to for packs
what's that
the events need the content right yeah
exactly and and and like it's it's super
super easy to do
yeah
yeah a lot of stuff like that a lot of
expertise stuff um one thing i i'm
really interested in looking into and
like
the near future is like how to become an
expert uh on like traditional news
stations which is apparently also very
easy so like
uh
the stock guy one of the dudes we rap um
we got him on cnbc once
and now he's like
getting reached out to for cnbc all the
time
and like because he's the he's the we
got him on under the guise of like the
meme expert when everybody didn't
understand what was happening with amc
and now they just like whenever there's
a meme thing like the internet's doing
something they understand call them up
that's awesome yeah so i think you can
do that too for like traditional media
and get huge press and like i don't
think this is so i never like really
tunneled on this because
i
was like well who cares it's a twitch
stream so like doesn't matter but if
you're a youtuber and you get on
traditional media like that crossover is
way that like that that is way better
right the the um the user acquisition
there is way better because you um there
there's so much less resistance so like
if you if i don't know i'm trying to
think of like where you might end up but
like
um if anything ever comes out in like
business insider or like like um
what's the one that starts with the v
um
verge or like um
cnbc where it comes into like gaming
news and things like that like
you can put yourself there and then i
think that the crossover audience that
comes from there to your youtube
channels is like [ __ ] crazy
yeah yeah
i think if you're trying to be like a
personality that could be really really
interesting especially
yeah i agree i think so too
like um so i think more about that like
expert becoming an expert in a field is
also really interesting oh the other
thing i did i tell you about the
linkedin thing i'm doing
no okay i've maybe i heard about a
little bit but not so
linkedin is has a creator program that
they're offering they just put like some
huge amount of money into is is tens of
millions of dollars behind creators on
linkedin
and they have a creator program where
they're accepting people
and they're giving a fifteen thousand
dollar grant
um
to
basically like get mentored by the
people at linkedin to create content on
linkedin and they boost your stuff
and and so like i am applying for that
and it's and like i also i think that
linkedin is another place you can set up
expertise
like these are just things like like i
think the longer that you build your
career out the the more you will become
an expert and the less like a front line
trench warfare like gaming content
creator
oh yeah for sure and as that happens
like
the door is easy right yep then as that
happens i think like establishing these
channels through like
public speaking and and that sort of
thing
will actually eventually outpace because
like you'll reach a point where you can
like make 50 to 100 000 like showing up
for a public speaking event right like
and and then it's like okay
there's a problem with that you see
right because
if you're doing that you still have to
be the one to show up and speak yeah
right
so
don't i feel like it doesn't really fit
in my model i mean maybe it does maybe i
could build it with someone else but
i think it does it's just um i think it
does what i'm saying is like
i
you
know i mean i like speaking well this is
a long-term outlook i'm saying it's like
in in in 20 years when you're or not
even 20 years [ __ ] 20 years we're gonna
be like [ __ ] cyborgs but like in five
years like three to five years when your
business has evolved to the point where
like
you're already doing it you're just
doing it for your managers because like
like like you're an expert basically
that they go to
to
figure out how to like optimize these
channels and so like
it's a it's a it's a tap of a golf club
away to do that
externally it just may not seem like it
because you because you because you're
not front-facing right
so you're gonna get me on cnn devon or
what's up well yeah that's what i'm
saying is like like i think that i just
think start thinking about it and then i
think in like the yeah i i think as like
stuff starts to evolve with you like
you'll you'll start going that way
naturally and and yeah there's more
there
i'm thinking a lot about empire building
like the thing for me is actually
because i know most people really don't
like public speaking but i actually kind
of enjoy it like
i enjoy public speaking as long as i'm
talking about something that i actually
like and i'm prepared for it yeah
obviously i don't want to be put on the
spot but if like i would love to give a
presentation like at a convention
like
just to my friends or something that i
know will be like used by people
and i can provide value to them yeah
i like i just think it would be fun more
than anything
yeah and it wouldn't be that bad to make
like some ridiculous amount of money
like with one public speaking yeah i
guess yeah yeah like be all right
yeah like but as you if just like if you
start thinking about that let me know
like like because i think
um one of the things i'm thinking about
a ton is empire building right like and
the the the best example i have of this
was like on like actually it's actually
a really good example because it didn't
work and and that's arcade
right like so
when we now now that that's like
all over and done with like i can talk
about like what our strategy was there
like where we're essentially like we're
taking a dungeons and dragons base which
is like at the base level it's like okay
you play a game for a bunch of nerds and
then you're all like our magical elves
and [ __ ] but then like at an empire
level it's source books it's figurines
it's maps it's right and there's so like
you take a brand that has so many
potential upsells and you create
everything around it and and like full
stop if he hadn't have been
um well i'm very limited in what i can
say about this live if what happened had
happened had not happened um full stop
like two or three years
out from now that would have been the
most successful d d brand of all time no
no no doubt like there's no question
that would happen and and like so like i
love like the idea of like empire
building there's like there's like a
huge amount of [ __ ] to talk about there
dude i can talk all day about empire
building yeah that's literally what i do
yeah pretty much exactly
it's it's good
one thing i've been one thing i've been
struggling a lot or i i should say not
struggling but have been working on a
lot it's like
how do you make
your content like really exceptional
without a personality or like without
you in it
um
i think for the longest time like up
until about a year ago until we started
our minecraft channel like the biggest
thing that was holding me back was just
our content was not really that good
like it wasn't terrible but it was like
kind of just okay like nothing really
special
but with minecraft i feel like we really
took a big big step forward in terms of
just our actions i was about to say it's
insane
it really exploded things like so much
more for us
um and has also like kind of opened my
eyes to like actually making good videos
without me making the videos myself for
once
and i feel like man it's crazy like if
you just make really really good content
like nothing else matters like you will
be successful do you feel like you can
apply that across to um
other channels now that you know that
from minecraft
like did something did you have like a
like a satori moment
probably not like existing channels but
definitely a lot of our new channels
we're pretty much only doing stuff
that's like minecraft now
but for new games oh so it's more like
you're you're looking to create in
categories and niches that um
that would actually allow you to do
things like that
yeah and just like new content styles
like
because a lot of our older stuff is like
highlights or kind of like versus
content but now with minecraft we're
doing like actual scripted like stories
written
multiple people involved like
planned and executed concepts yeah
um it's just like a lot more
sophisticated which i think is really
has been really good
same with like the animations too that's
an insane idea
yeah those are so oh [ __ ] what's that
durable
sorry
i'm the only one at the office today
back
oh yeah oh you're at the office that's
cool
yeah always uh i'm the only one here
[Laughter]
yeah yeah this is th this is um
this has been insane because like the
the the number of sheer ideas like
the thing is like it it's it's difficult
to get into your head on the actual
creative process because like i can't
like know like how you like genesis a
lot of this stuff but i understand like
in concept like
that this is a skill that you can
practice and get better at if that makes
sense like you you you start by like
just giving yourself some time you set
up like 10 to 15 channels and then you
just like okay on this deadline i'll go
through this and i'll find everything
related to this category and then over
time you'll get better and better at
doing that
yeah like it's something i've been doing
for basically 10 years right yeah so
i definitely should be really bad at it
i also got so many ideas for like
just in general like about like i think
um
one thing that'd be really interesting
is running like a like a live stream
like business q and a like
like fast fire like rounds where like
you multi-stream reddit youtube facebook
and then
like just do that for like two hours
and see what and then like drive people
to like a youtube funnel
it's like crazy [ __ ] i could do there
it's definitely like hidden op i think
yeah i think since
yeah i i don't think it's that hard to
get on as well i have no idea what the
process is like i just know it's like
somewhat exclusive
and you're not allowed to stream as much
as you want
interesting
yeah every time i every time i go on
there's some dude playing a banjo for
like [ __ ] 10 000 viewers
it's really interesting
the streamers on red always do some kind
of like wide appeal thing it seems like
yeah like music people or like animals
kind of stuff seems like
yeah i think music people and then like
i only see music people or just like
yeah i don't know what it takes to get
there i'll let you know though because
i'm gonna try to pursue it
yeah that'll be that'll be pretty cool
actually yeah
we'll see if it works
well damn man um
are we good is there anything you want
to talk about
really this or whatever
um
yeah i'd be curious to talk a little bit
more about like
options for product creation in gaming
because that's kind of what i'm trying
to do right now
the biggest thing i'm working on is i'm
trying to build like a really big
minecraft server
and i know you can do like a patreon
um i guess i don't know if i really have
a question here because i'm kind of just
like
thinking about this on the spot
um
but it's more so just like what kind of
advice do you have for like actual
product creation
specifically within gaming especially
if they're i don't know it's kind of a
broad question so
yeah i think um
i think i have a lot to add there
like but more of it's all just like i
think that's like offline stuff because
like um i can like
throw a bunch of stuff at you that we're
doing in the agency level and like also
can like get involved too because
there's there's like i like i think we
should try
um
merch for the minecraft channel for sure
but definitely and then i and then i
think um
one person i could link you up with who
i think is like actually a hidden op
master of like um
in-game item sales is a is hotshot
oh interesting but i think we could do a
three-way call that would be insanely
valuable because um he ran a um
ragnarok online server like that had all
in-game purchases and just did
phenomenal like like so i think there's
pretty much a ton of value yeah yeah
it's exactly the same thing so i think
there's like a ton of value to do there
and i would be interested in that call
too just to like like kind of like learn
what he knows in that context although i
i've heard some of it but like i think
he'd like you know when you get him
thinking in that context would be really
good so we could do that too
i'm happy to do that anytime
okay i'll i'll set that up
yeah sounds good other than that have
you been man
i think um
i i think pretty good um
the
the uh
the transition
like from a content perspective the
transition from twitch to youtube and to
patreon um happened way quicker than i
thought it would because i i was like
very surprised where the patreon is now
yeah i really like what you said in one
of your patreon videos where it's like
you said you're making the same amount
as you were on twitch but you're
spending like one-tenth of the time
actually doing it
which is i think really smart it's also
way less uh parasocial like like i'm not
dealing with the wide negativity that i
dealt with like being public facing on
twitch
but my total reach is greater somehow
because youtube views
um
beat unique views every time
but like it's actually crazy that like
usually when you're thinking about
something like like you're thinking
about some kind of like
way to do something there's at least
like one redeeming factor but there's
literally there's no reason to stream on
twitch it's just zero
it's all negative it's like like it's
unless you want to be a twitch streamer
for some reason but i don't know why
anyone would want to do that even
even if you
even if you truly love the platform like
which i do i think like i really do like
it like just the number the sheer number
of um
miserable things that come across for it
even
for people that are like
like really love what they do is like
insane right like
there's there's examples of this was
like
you know you look at like miss kiff and
maya for example like where
like misgive like legitimately loves the
platform streaming but just it's just
not sustainable to run a relationship
like like like you can't just use your
girlfriend for content or vice versa
right like it just like it just
introduces so many problems that like
like jasmine and i
identified really quickly like this just
is not going to be a thing
like
like like we're just like like we're
either going to um it's either going to
be like a race to the bottom to like use
each other for content in like
embarrassing ways that like compromise
the relationship or
um like whatever other untenable stuff
you could you set up enough okay like
yeah so
i just personally hate streaming yeah
i don't enjoy the process like
i have realized i really hate doing
things that are not scalable
um
i thought about a lot before but i just
feel like
like the fact that my youtube channels
are infinitely scalable and it's like
fully outsourced i feel like that's like
the one thing i have that makes me feel
like my company is awesome
and if like i've i have tried or at
least thought about doing things where i
kind of take that away
and i just realized like wow it actually
made me like really depressed if you
like take that aspect away like i feel
like that's part of my identity
and like it's part of why
i
feel like i'm cool as a just as a person
in general
um which was kind of interesting
um but i personally just think like
streaming's just not fun for me
i don't i don't really enjoy it i'd
rather do something that's like
infinitely scalable
i agree
but like also like even if you do enjoy
it like having the ability to enjoy it
on a level like dream does where he can
just click the start streaming button
because of his actual like properly set
up funnels right and then like people
just come in like that's like way
preferable because you just have no
stress attached to the actual process
yeah streaming like dream does is
probably really fun like yeah just once
a month like oh i kind of feel like
streaming today let's see what's up and
then you just stream and just do
whatever you want and then
you have 500 000 viewers yeah which and
like i don't even think it has to be
like that crazy but just the concept of
like okay like i'm i'm truly not
attached to these outcomes or results
because i've built my funnels correctly
so that my user acquisition happens at a
higher level and stays there and then
like if i want to live stream it's
because i want to like interact with my
community on a more well like that's the
only thing i miss about livestreaming is
like interacting with actual cool people
that i really enjoy talking to but the
discord has actually like replaced that
to a huge degree because um we have
these like
yeah discord's been awesome but we have
these like really active uh chats a lot
of the time in like the afternoons and
evenings where um they'll just be people
hanging out in like general chats and so
i just go in there just like hop in
there and just talk to people
yeah definitely
so like like you could
it be and that like that
segways you away from like if i stream
now like you know you get lsf read it
like
people again i think what you said about
facebook streaming that's a really
[ __ ] good idea for a video like just
the whole like
oh like uh
if you're on facebook streaming you just
like it's so much harder to be an
[ __ ] like
because it's like yeah i saw that
disguised video too it's like ben from
germany university yeah yeah exactly
like
yeah it's it's it's like that small
um
that anonymous anonymity is like such a
huge source of um
a lot of problems
like like just
yeah and and and yeah it's like the
whole thing behind it but
now i've been been really good like um
i'm i'm happier than i've been and i'm
dealing with like a ton of like really
stressful [ __ ] like just on a family
level and like like not like bad stuff
but just like logistically
like just like getting jasmine and i set
up in like a more permanent basis in the
united states is like a whole thing and
like
yeah
but like really really awesome you're
doing that though yeah and like and but
like like my happiness level is
increased because i just don't have like
um
like well need to go live from 12 to 4
every day you know
oh yeah
i i remember i got so much happier once
i like fully quit streaming for good
yeah
yeah sam
um i've like replaced a lot of the time
with like tai chi they've been doing my
tai chi for a while um it's been
incredibly great
i just do more youtube channels
create another youtube channel
yeah it's some
at some level you have to um optimize
optimize for personal care i don't know
like we could have a lot of conversation
about that i'm not sure like how much
you've thought about that
oh i'm very optimized like
i'm honestly like not really working
that hard these days
oh really
yeah
really not it's like everything is
really optimized even our new channel
process has been really optimized now
and because of minecraft like
because of the success with minecraft
i've basically been put into a situation
where i basically just have like 20
people that are that we that are proven
that are really good that we know are
good that's so cool that want to start
channels with me
and so i'm basically just like
doing channels that i want with the
existing group of people that we already
know so i don't even have to like hire
people anymore they're just there
damn that's [ __ ] awesome
like every week more people are asking
me to do channels with them and i'm like
well you know i can't do channels right
now but maybe in the future so it's like
i got i got the full squad for all our
new channels right now and i got like
the squad for like five more people
lined up in the future too actually
that's so cool yeah it's really that's
that's i feel like the lab is getting to
that point as well where like there's
just a lot of people there that are like
very skilled and i'm genuinely happy to
be around especially like thumbnail
creation is getting good yeah yeah
a lot of people that are like really
good research is like kicking up too
like that's like the next step um
people that are there are getting better
and better people that are coming in are
very good and like um
getting to the point where like even in
consulting i can throw like uh a budget
every time to them and then they can
like actually provide a lot of value on
top of what i'm doing so
it's interesting do you do any
consulting right now
um
i've never done paid consulting
generally i've done i've done some
consulting for people that i just like
that are my friends i guess thank you um
i have done some consulting for like
some companies
or more specifically people at companies
like ryden blizzard
but it was never like paid i just did it
out of like goodwill
and because i thought it was fun
i don't think i would ever want to do
paid consulting because
or i should say at least right now i
wouldn't really want to do paid
consulting because
the reason why i enjoy consulting is
because i don't
have to feel that pressured to get
results like i can just kind of go and
have a fun conversation and if it helps
the other person that's great and if it
doesn't then it's fine because i didn't
get paid
um and the income like
just doing something on an hourly or
even if it's like a retainer basis
whatever
i
don't want to like build an income
source that's reliant on me to do
anything yeah um it's just like not fun
for me i guess
um i think it's more fun to build
something that
doesn't rely on my time
mm-hmm yeah just saying
just a difference of like uh
viewpoint there because like i i i like
charging a
high allergy weight that that's enough
that i can uh that i i know the time is
worth it but also like i
i is like actually going to like i'm
positive and sure that that is going to
provide value to that person at that
rate like way more value than they
expect but but it does put a lot of
responsibility on you because like you
real like you really have to try and
like really think about them and their
problem and like get a lot of
information beforehand and vet your
clients turn down a bunch of clients
because um like like you may not feel
like you can help them at that level
that kind of thing yeah
yeah and it's also more so a case of
just like
doing it for money makes it a lot less
fun because yeah of course the person's
gonna have expectations and i'll say
okay i'm probably doing it for someone
maybe i don't know them
[Music]
maybe i'm not really as interested in
their success that much compared to
someone that's like my friend or someone
that i met in real life at some point
i'd be very curious to see what would
happen if i paid you for consulting
i've kind of thought about it but at the
same time i don't really
know what i could ask you for help with
well there's no universe where
you could do that because i just we just
have a phone call
yeah
like there's no universe where i've ever
i like dude we're going to fight over
splaying the bill at dinner
that's where i'm at like yeah like i i i
yeah that's like
that's the thing like
um
there's a certain like like
w with
friends who are also like serious
professionals there's a certain like
i don't know like that this is like with
like matt and i right like
matt is my co the co-owner of novo is
like such a professional that like we
just trade services like like and don't
even think about it and it evens out in
the end
because like
he might provide me some insane value on
something i i don't know about and then
i might hopefully do the same
at some other level and like it just
trades that way
like um
one of the things like uh
it's weird how it works but like
um
i was talking to
[Music]
i've be i could tell you more about this
offline but like i was talking to a
very very high level executive at a
company um
and
i just like threw in the it's actually
crazy how much how how often this works
but i just threw in this pitch i was
just like
hey like could i bother you with some
bullet point questions for a 30 minute
phone call once a month
and this is a person that runs like a 6
000 person company right and there's
like yeah
and like i've
had that relationship with at least one
executive consistently
and like
even if you're
like no matter what if you're a manager
of people at any level like it's worth
doing and like it's weird too because
like
it's one of those things like you just
talked about where it's like you know i
could like never
throw the value back on that guy but
like in a weird way like the the
mentorship is its own reward
yeah it's just fun like if you make it
easy and simple yeah
and like
are a good student it's fun to just
mentor people right
yeah exactly like
that that's that has been invaluable to
me like um one of my big mentors like
early on in management was kevin lynn
like one of the original
people that worked on twitch he's like
ceo at the time
and that i i i talked to him through
that pitch it was just hey 30 minutes
i ended up like getting like i think we
did billy phone calls for like two or
three years
and it just added so much value because
i was like how do you manage [ __ ] like
how do you think about goal setting for
your staff and these like it's like
relevant to any business thing and then
like you take good notes go apply it
tell them next week like what happened
it's really good yeah it's awesome yeah
actually this would be a good time for
us to go offline if you want to talk
more yeah sure let's do it yeah yeah um
yeah so people that are watching um
thank you for being here uh i will
probably toss this up on patreon and or
or youtube or somewhere um it was good
and uh please thank jeremy as well most
of all um and support him in any way he
cares to be supported i i don't i don't
know how
well
uh i don't really need support to be
honest like
all the stuff we're doing i'll be able
to grow just fine
i don't really have anything to promote
like i don't really need to promote
anything so
uh just thanks for watching i guess
thanks for listening i'm honored that
you would listen to me talk for an
extended period of time so that's really
cool
hope you guys learned something maybe
thanks for watching you guys are on the
discord too coming out to our first
