hello
one of the things i hear from personal
development and self-improvement gurus
all the time is morning routines are
super important and i never figured this
out because i've actually always been a
night owl i've always been a person who
goes to sleep at like two to five a.m
and then wakes up around like 11 and 12.
and i've had a couple of exceptions to
this in my life but i've never really
seen the value of like getting up early
in the morning and figuring things out
but a while ago and i'd say a while ago
i'd say like four or five or six months
ago i decided that i really wanted to
change this and i wanted to
set up a series of routines and just
feel good stuff that i could do in a day
that would make me more effective as an
executive and also just more happy as a
person and more fulfilled and i think
six months later i've done that and i've
kind of come up with some things that i
want to share today and you might say
well
is this relevant to business or
marketing or media which we usually
teach and i'd say yes it absolutely is
because it'll make you a way more
effective business person in fact this
might be one of the most important
videos that you watch i'm going to try
to include some things in here that
would be not so obvious alongside some
of the ones that are obvious and also
like how i did it
so okay so the first one is the you know
i always like to start with obvious
stuff
early rising i think
has been a massive change in my personal
productivity and um i when i say early i
mean i think that you aim for
five to six in the morning to get into
work or not at all so that means you're
getting up around like 4 30 or or
something like that and the value there
is that you have three to five hours of
focus before anybody bothers you and
this has been massive for me that when
person that gets 50 to 60 messages on
discord every day
dozens of emails right
this this time to think about what the
business should be in the mornings has
been very valuable i've always had a
problem though with going to sleep um on
time because i just i
have this there's actually a really good
word for this
that i learned
from somebody
uh
let me search it real quick this is such
a cool description
so there is a japanese term which it
looks like this
and it's called revenge bedtime
procrastination so in english we have no
concept of this but in in japan it's a
concept that says the feeling that you
didn't get enough time during the day
and you want to regain that freedom
during your late night hours once i was
able to identify what this was then i
was able to work back through the logic
and realize okay well if i sleep on time
i actually have more time because i'm
not
i'm not limited like there's 24 hours in
a day and oftentimes when your sleep
schedule is irregular you are going to
sleep more than you might intend but if
you sleep on the same schedule you get
the same amount of hours actually over
time you end up saving hours because
you're sleeping less overall but you're
healthier and in addition to that you're
gonna be more effective like during the
mornings and things like that so so i uh
learned this concept want to share with
you and it helped me become an early
riser and then
um
what i did to actually fix my sleep
schedule was i just hard
woke up no matter what no matter how
tired i was i would wake up at a certain
time it's like okay i might go to bed at
one i'm up at 4 30 no matter what and
for a while i was having a problem
because i i attend a late night podcast
occasionally on thursdays which usually
goes to like one or two in the morning
and i would finally get on these good
sleep schedules and then i would it
would just all reset because i would be
on this podcast and
so i fixed that by just getting up on
the time i would get up normally and
like you're tired for the day well don't
screw up the next day and you'll learn
over time to do this it takes quite a
bit of self-discipline but this has been
one of the major things that i've done
that is that has really really improved
my life i i think there's enormous value
in thinking about your business
conceptually in a time where nobody else
is bothering you
and what i mean by that is
you sit back and you say okay what
should my business be are we going the
right direction i i think a lot about
the overarching business and what it's
doing like what branches and verticals
we're moving into where we're getting
most of our revenue from where we should
be getting revenue from and i think
about that in the context of my life too
and maybe like big order thinking is
another idea for a video i had but it's
outside the context of this video
the next thing i do is i don't eat
um i only drink water and i always try
to drink about a gallon of water a day
and
i don't eat because one i think
breakfast
messes with your
scale of time where like a lot of people
they eat they like relax and now like
maybe they had a meal that's pretty
heavy in carbohydrates unless you're
very careful with your healthy
unless you're very careful and healthy
and just eat like eggs and
such you are going to maybe immediately
get a sugar spike but um
so many people like their work day they
spend the enormous amount of time eating
uh they'll they'll go to breakfast and
then they'll go to work for a couple of
hours like kind of settle in by that
time it'll be lunch then they'll come to
the there'll be meetings in the
afternoon everybody's awake everybody
wants to bother you and then before you
notice five o'clock six o'clock you're
back from work and like this is how the
average office worker works like an hour
so i don't ever eat until 6 to 10 p.m
that's my eating window when i get home
and everything's done i find i'm way
sharper in the mornings now i've talked
to a lot of people that they're like i
don't know how you get by doing this i
can't survive for like four hours
without eating uh these are people that
i recommend try internet intermittent
fasting or in some kind of fast where
you just
disassociate your body from like the
need to eat the with those the hormones
like ghrelin are really strong if you're
never accustomed to that but i i've been
doing monthly fasts or bi-monthly fasts
for i'd say the better part of like
almost a decade now and i i have like no
association with that i i won't i won't
eat until a certain time you can
definitely control that um as of yet i
haven't found anybody that can't do that
so i don't eat uh i drink a lot of water
and that kind of brings me to my my next
thing which is uh i drink really good
green tea and this may seem kind of
crazy like wait this is a this is one of
them um but
green tea has a couple components in it
that are real beneficial to effective
work and also just like mood and
fulfillment one is
one that everyone knows the caffeine
right the same thing in coffee and at
this point i think that caffeine is
pretty reliably a
good thing to consume if you are trying
to think faster and and uh on your feet
but another lesser known ingredient in
green tea is l-theanine which is a um
uh uh it's it's really difficult to
describe what it does chemically but
it's more like a mental balancer and it
really helps with your um
your like it helps edge where coffee
like has a spike in this caffeine level
l-theanine helps edge that out um but
also makes you
uh also helps a lot with neurological
benefits
uh i i'll give a quick aside for green
tea the green tea that i use is from a
company called
todd and holland not sponsored by them
or anything they don't give me any money
but you can actually put my name in uh
and just say like devin nash sent me and
they it's a very small business like a
mom and pop store in chicago somewhere
and they uh they know who i am
uh and they'll probably they might like
send you something extra or something
for that uh because like i've like
referred people to them for years
because it's literally the only green
tea that i've ever found it's just like
the quality i really want i go with
chinese green teas because japanese
green teas typically are very grassy and
difficult for beginners and then i
choose from this list and they're there
you can't really go wrong um
but you might be watching this video
years later so all these t's will be
different so they change quite often but
just read the descriptions and see what
you like um they're they're amazing so
todd and holland is a phenomenal green
tea provider and uh you'll need like a
t-ball it's like a dollar and you can
just get uh or you can get one of these
like little cups from world market where
you can put the uh you can put the
like uh container in the cup and then
you can just brew the loose leaf tea but
via that what's all you need is a spoon
these are like i don't know seven bucks
this is mainly what i use actually
i don't even do the official stuff
green tea i think is like one of the
things would be hard for me to live
without it is just like a companion
throughout my entire day some people use
coffee i use green tea as a fantastic
creative process helper and um it's it's
this is great it's phenomenal the next
thing that i do is uh i meditate i use
zen meditation and zen meditation is
something that um i'm a zen buddhist and
i could explain this to you in two
seconds as you
uh
face a wall or something nondescript
keep your eyes open and focus on your
breathing and sit up straight and put
your hands in your lap that's it that's
meditation focus on your breathing when
your thoughts go to somewhere else bring
them back to your breathing do that for
i do it for 10 minutes every time i
enter the office and i use the entering
the office as my trigger to meditate so
i'll do at least five or six times a
week i'll meditate for 10 minutes
so they take like half days on saturdays
and that small i also meditate when i'm
leaving the office so that's another
trigger so it's 20 minutes total it's
been an enormous help um i can't speak
enough about meditation and just the
benefits that it provides um they're
scientifically there that's phenomenal
and then the um the next thing i do is
after i've like gone come to the office
i've fixed my green tea meditated uh i
read non-fiction for a little bit
um
and right now i'm reading this book zen
mind beginner's mind which i read like a
passage of it which is just a kind of a
commentary on
um
uh the mind and and kind of how we
interact with reality and i'll read all
kinds of non-fiction that will always be
self-improvement oriented um
and
it is enormously helpful um
to just like set your mind in the right
way
and then
i will start working on the big picture
thinking that i want to do first so
things that i need to just like
carefully consider myself like where is
the company going how do we increase our
results um what resources do i need to
build i'll make sure i'm organized so
i'll make sure i know what to do like
what are the most important things i
need to do today just be asking myself
those big questions going forward and
then i'll get to work and this sounds
like a pretty involved process because
i'm explaining it out in this like video
but it's not it's it's it's a really
straightforward process that like in
total probably takes
um
you know
20 minutes of time 10 of which is
meditating and and it's it's uh
incredibly effective um
so
you don't have to follow this rubric
exactly although if you did i think
you'd find quite a bit of success
but what i challenge you to do is is say
okay
not like a lot of people are thinking
about how to become a better content
creator how to become a better business
person or how do i make more money or
whatever and they see
that as a direct day to be like well i
need to get more viewers or
i need to sell more products or whatever
um but they don't see that like changing
their own
relationship
to
the their the everyday
uh
will change their relationship
to their business and and like their
overall success so like all these like
things in this list
maybe you're a content creator and
you're saying well i wish he had made a
video on exactly how to get viewers on
twitch or something like that and then i
tell you that like well if you did these
five things you'd probably get you'd
probably be way further along than the
vast majority of broadcasters and that
might not make sense but what happens
when you're more focused is like let's
say that you
have two hours
a day okay that are to work more
than
someone else
so somebody works four hours you work
six okay and by work i also mean
something subjective
work for most people means
dick around on reddit
sit and um
watch youtube videos don't matter um
research right
uh not really work right but you work
like six actual real hours
you are gaining
assuming that you
are working
uh two additional hours five days a week
right you're gaining 10 additional hours
every week and then that's 40 hours a
month right and then if you that's 480
hours a year
and if you're effective at that
you have exponential results over other
people and this is how people that are
unbelievably successful entrepreneurs
get ahead of other people when they have
the same amount of time in a day they're
just very effective so
you may not see the direct translation
here
i would argue that
the
getting your practices in in hand
is more important than absolutely any
thing you do
in terms of like technique or or
business-wise like
so much will come to you
because
you are taking the time to create this
space
and
to to do the right way like everything
is dependent on your mind i'm starting
to sound like a weird oprah guru or
something but when you think about it
like your entire business
your your marketing funnel your content
everything especially your content man
if you're a creative
is from your mind right like all of it
is genesis from that
so
your your techniques around how you hone
that
are
real important and not to be
underestimated
and if you work more
effectively than other people
which is not hard to do because most
people just do not work effectively so
few people work effectively
that i would argue that if you even had
two hours but you really put it into the
number one thing you needed to be doing
you would be so much more successful
than you are now
um
so
there's a lot of like mental blocks
and and things that get in your head
um that i i can't address in the context
of this video that's like i'm not good
enough or
um i'm afraid of creating this video or
things like that these are things that i
run into
which are one of the big problems around
the creative side of my main youtube
channel like um
i believe that i'm
qualified enough to talk about nfts for
example because i've researched them so
much but i don't want to make a video on
them because i'm not exactly like right
where i am
in the uh
in my mental to think that i'm it's
worth making a video because i don't
know if my contest could be good enough
that's like a mental barrier that's
something that i should be
ignoring and and passing through and
just making that video so there's a lot
of things to to think about on your own
what
these are in personal development these
are called limiting beliefs look more
into this is a what limiting beliefs do
i have right i can't make videos about
xyz subject i'm not enough of an expert
to make videos about this all right what
limiting beliefs do i have how do i
stomp those beliefs that might be
something i think about
in the in the context of this process
that you're doing every morning but
these things that i'm mentioning here
these five things
these are immutable right it doesn't
matter what your barriers are you can do
all these things
and so i would start there and allow
yourself to create the space to do these
things
uh and and i think you would you'll be
really surprised like what happens make
this like your big focus right um
this should be more important
than
any business goal or self-development
goal or job goal that you have
i particularly like this strategy in the
context of working jobs because if you
have three or four hours before you even
get to work
to
focus on
what's most important to you which could
be work right you will crush it compared
to other people
so i think that's all i have to say
about this i i hope it helps it's not
too weird it's a little bit esoteric we
don't tend to think about
improving our business in in in terms of
what
we should do with our our own
development time
but this is really important uh another
last minute note i don't have exercise
on this list because i haven't
implemented that yet i i think um i'm
trying to keep it simple and add things
that i know i can stay consistent with
and exercise still
is outside of that i i do walk to work
so i walk a mile each way so i've walked
a mile by the time i i do this process
but i don't truly exercise if you can
add that in that's another one that is i
think immutable you know the immutable
six here
okay so i hope that helps and you can
always post comments or tell me what you
think about this process and i'd love to
hear from you thanks everybody bye
