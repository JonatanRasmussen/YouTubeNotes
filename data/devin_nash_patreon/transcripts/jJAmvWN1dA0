there's a concept that i keep revisiting
every single quarter i go back to again
and again and again and that's
productivity i think about time
management i think about productivity
because i know that if you get this one
concept right you can do everything else
everything else falls into place so i'm
reinventing this concept over and over
again trying new things listening to new
ideas and i want to share a compilation
of where i'm at with that right now and
the actual tactical practice that i use
to become more productive and how you
might be able to apply that as well and
we're also going to dispel one of the
misconceptions around productivity so my
goal
is to get four to six hours
maximum of
highly productive work into a day and a
lot of people say well don't you need to
work eight or 10 or 15 or whatever
you don't
four to six hours a day of critical work
if you could identify that is going to
be more than enough to be able to get
you wherever you want to go unless you
are trying to go for insane levels of
success
four to six hours a day absolute maximum
and i'm talking like build multi-million
dollar businesses on four six hours no
problem so i'm going to show you one of
the
thought exercises i did this week with
actual problems that i'm working with in
my agency and how i categorize them and
how i actually figured out how to do it
and what we what we ended up doing with
it so okay so we're gonna switch here
and
just outline some of the really
important concepts first
so concept number one
is you only need four or six hours
already explained that secondly in one
day
you only
need
to accomplish
one super important thing
that actually happens
and pushes your company brand service
whatever forward okay that's it that's
you've got to do that one super
important thing you really have to
compartmentalize because
what i've what i've been thinking about
productivity
i actually probably struggle with this a
lot more than people think
by watching these videos and by kind of
ascertaining the person that i am
or that i seem to be through this i
actually struggle a ton of productivity
and distraction
reddit like twitter social media there
it feels like i was watching a lot of
youtube videos about productivity and it
kind of like pissed me off because
there's just nothing that covers like
the sheer ease of distraction like
literally going to a browser and just
typing reddit.com and then reading all
the threads and then you just get away
from that it's 30 minutes later it's an
hour later there's nothing of value
that's ever happened you can't even
remember anything or it's worse it's
like negative you're doomed scrolling
especially in this day and age with like
active wars going on and everything or
the stock market being the way it is or
the economy you just do scroll yourself
into this um
this negative state of mind and it work
becomes more difficult i i had to
address this in my own life and i mean
like i don't want to like bs about
all the all the stuff on youtube and all
this content about dealing with this is
just bs it's like all um mindset stuff i
want to provide like actual tactical
stuff but how i'm handling this and like
how i'm really handling this day to day
that's what this is about
so you need to accomplish like just
outlining him first like you have to
accomplish that one super important
thing that like if all else fails you
waste your entire rest of your day you
still have to like have that one victory
like gun to your head okay this is the
thing that you absolutely have to do
what is it you want to mark that down
okay so those are the two concepts we're
working with and now i'm just going to
show you so this week i have
well at the beginning of this week i
have like three major options that i
could do for nova okay so novo is for
people that are following novo is a
creative agency we represent brands to
influencers and we
um
do advertising campaigns in the space
for people so that's that's what we do
because just providing context for um
these projects so there's three projects
project number one project number two
and project number three so as an
executive i have a choice to work on all
three of these um there's also multiple
other things but project number one is
going to be
reinventing
sales cadence
and script which means we use outbound
scripts to go approach companies uh for
our product and service and i those have
not been updated in a couple of quarters
now and i want to update those so that
the sales team and i can be more
effective in how we sell so that's
probably number one reinventing the
website so if you go to
nova.tv
and you look at the website it's sort of
a previous iteration of the company that
was more creator focused and we've
changed quite a bit in how we do things
and i'd like to like update this website
with new copy appealing to um like our
more
relevant like demographic now it's
different and then secondly i want to do
a novo one page so i like doing these
for all companies
um if you can't tell the focus this week
is like bigger marketing projects
another one page means like is there a
one-page document that i can send
somebody that just explains what we do
who we are and like how to take next
steps okay so now that i have these
projects down i did a brainstorming how
i got here was i did a brainstorming
session where i said what are the most
important things that i can focus on in
the company right now that are not like
urgent things so there's like tasks
right because i could be doing
merchandising marketing i can be doing
merch updates or our current like merch
programs um some like influencer
correspondence or
deal contract flow like there's parts of
this stuff that has to be done and then
i could also do content right like
personal youtube
or patreon so how do you sort all this
stuff out well for just these creative
projects i took these three important
things and said okay i'm going to rank
these in terms of importance okay so for
my decision making this gets a 5 out of
5 to reinvent the website because we're
actually getting a lot of inbound from
the website that really surprised me i
kind of thought that websites were sort
of an outdated thing that people don't
really pay attention to but they do they
do pay attention to them and especially
brands pay attention to them so updating
the website is the most important thing
that i can do because it will actually
lead us to consistent passive inbounds
so that's what i need to do the second
most important thing i need to do is the
nova 1 page because once i have that
consistent inbound coming in so
companies are asking me hey how do we
work with you i need to have something
to show them so nova one page is the
second thing and then finally the
outbound sales script is the
third most important thing but still
important and all this stuff sort of
fits into a normal schedule but as far
as like my creative work goes this is
what i'm going to focus on so the first
step i'm doing and being productive is
i'm understanding clearly what the most
important thing for me to work on is
it's reinventing the website it's
writing out copy it's writing out script
for me to for someone to put on a
website and to knock that ball over
there and the way i'm gonna do that is
i'm going to calendar it right so i'm
going to look at this um this is a
picture of my account well it's a
screenshot of my calendar the black
boxes are just meetings that i had to
black out because they're with um brands
or companies and stuff
and you'll see that i don't so i
generally sleep from like two to nine i
get into the office about 10
and after like everything is done like
my any kind of like physical stuff i do
or whatever
and then i don't take any meetings until
about one
later if i can and that's because the
first part of my day and the last part
of my day so like one to three pm
and then when i'm in the office past six
i am purely creative i'm purely
designing and working on projects all
the other stuff that has to be done in
the company goes into these slots and
any kind of meetings and stuff goes into
those slots but then that time i protect
so that i can do my most important
things and make sure they get done and i
want so if this is like too big of a
thing to do like this is like
reinventing the website is too big of a
thing to do over
one day i will just make a sub goal and
sort of gamify that
and i'll say okay um i'm going to do
30 of the front page or i'm going to i
mean i'll probably more
objective than that i'll say like i'm
going to write
at least six to seven paragraphs of the
front page today and at least one page
right of like a word document or google
doc
and then that will be my success metric
and then i'll get that done okay and
then tactically during that creative
period of time
i will do what i will use
a chrome extension called stay focused
stay focused is a chrome extension where
if you
activate it you can activate what's
called a nuclear option the nuclear
option allows you to block
a
uh
everything on your block sites list
which is going to be things like reddit
twitter
anything that is going to distract my
time because
if i do not physically block that
website i will not work i will i will
work but i won't work at the
effectiveness level that i want to i
will just like end up going to reddit
reading threads and things like that so
the first thing
i do is i calendar so i'm like once i
understand the schedule i'm going to
block out the creative time so you'll
see me do this
on the calendar i'll just literally
schedule this time and i'll and then
once i hit that time physically like
it's that time so let's say that time
for creative is going to be 12 to 2
o'clock for example then i will just
block this for two hours physically all
my blocked websites and so you want to
put on this this is a totally free app
you can just get it on chrome
and it's open source github you can see
there's no like weird stuff about it
and i will go for this nuclear option
i'll just hit the button and then what
will happen is it'll just pop up and say
shouldn't you be working and it will
remind you there'll be like that trigger
that you
should be you that you won't be able to
access the website so you can disable
the extension and you can get around
this but at that point you're just
sabotaging yourself and like you need
you know a therapist more so than this
video or whatever so you obviously have
to have um you have to adhere to your
own self-discipline but i mean that's
the basis of everything right shouldn't
be but this is what this is meant to do
is it's supposed to
trigger you out
of the automatic
mindset of okay i'm gonna go and i'm
gonna go read something i'm gonna do
something different so all you stay
focused to
um
block out that time
after i so i guess step one is to use
the calendar
to block out
the specific time to work on
your most important project
two i'll use the chrome extension and
three i'll play light non-vocal music
with no other distractions
that's it right
and
the other thing i'll do around this and
this is something i haven't ever talked
about
because i think it's a little bit weird
so uh you just like here's your kind of
tactical advice businessy stuff i'm just
getting so what i'll do
i don't know how this is going to go
it's going to be kind of weird for
people uh i guess it's on the patreon so
it's okay but
who knows some of these videos go out
but yeah
i will sit down uh i'll burn some
incense and i'll meditate on death
and i'll say this is what i do the
beginning of every office day so i'll
say
if i i know i'm gonna die i know my time
is going to be limited so do i want to
spend that time
being
on reddit consuming stupid social media
comparing myself to other influencers
looking at what other people are doing
or do i really want that time to be
worth something because i know my time
is limited i know my body is decaying i
know my time is going to be up i don't
know when and so i really need to make
this day worth it and i will just
meditate on that thought for 10 minutes
and then i'll start working i have found
that that centers my mind in a way
because everything i just said was true
i just think it might be a little bit
like weird or spiritual for some people
so sometimes i keep that out of these
kind of things but i feel like it's
important because it's just a critical
aspect of
that that thought process is a critical
aspect of my productivity it helps
inform these other decisions and gives
me a reason
why i want to be productive with which
you also have to define so after that um
i just play my music and i go and i go
until the end and then i'll either take
a break set up another block or whatever
and i'll do this for four to six hours a
day to get done
the major projects that i think need to
get done and then at the end of the week
i will review them you might have seen
in my calendar on fridays i always have
a learning review session in the
afternoon so what that does is it's just
going through everything that i did and
figuring out what went right what was a
good use of time and what wasn't
and
that's essentially
the entire process of productivity
that i do
so
i i think
the biggest threat to productivity is
actually distraction
and
everything on our computers as power
users has gotten so good at it so
ridiculously good that it's to the point
where i don't think any amount of
self-discipline can probably fix you
without using physical tools to block
out the websites at least in my case
that are going to be offenders of this
and i want to be able to get home every
day because i end up getting home at
about 10 or 11 every day
and i want to be able to
really feel like i added something
to to to what i wanted to do because
because why am i here right like why am
i going into this office
and doing these things
if just to waste time why are you at
work
when you could be doing anything else
with your life
if you are not trying to really
accomplish something either
to earn your own freedom monetarily or
to build something that is incredibly
meaningful to you and in my case it's
both
i don't want that time to die and like
the saddest thing to me
is
how much
time just gets eaten up by like useless
useless social media
that's not
that's not only
not productive
it's like it like it would be one thing
if it was even just purely neutral but
it's actually negative actually pulls
away from your life
completely like it just it drives you
into these states of thinking that the
entire world is like screwed
that everything's messed up and then
these constant opinions and comparisons
and and talk and consumption that gets
done
by people that
are influencers or they themselves are
not even people you should be looking up
to
or comparing yourself to like the
pedestals we put these people up to
because we're just trying to get away
from the things we really need to do
it really bothers me so i just don't
want to be that person i want to be a
person who like owns my own time and
it's like a war to get that back every
day we need to talk more about this it's
like crazy how hard it is to not even
deal with like simple distractions in
the day because of how good companies
have gotten at drawing our attention
even so much so as like the average
office worker working like an hour and a
half or less a day now right like that's
the output that we have so
if you want to
[Music]
really be productive
you've got to brainstorm out the most
important things you need to do
and then you have to
actually go to war with yourself and
your distractions and i i mean that like
literally like you need to actually use
programs and tools and extensions
and concepts and visualizations that put
you in a place where
you cannot waste your time because life
isn't too short you just need to do more
okay let me know what you think it's a
shorter video than most but i think it's
just as important thanks we'll talk to
you soon bye
