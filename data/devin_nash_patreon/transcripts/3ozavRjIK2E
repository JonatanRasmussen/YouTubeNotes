hello hello it has been a while since we
have done a super high value video So
today we're going to be talking about
top funnel marketing or how to get more
customers via certain platforms we're
going to be going over all of the
platforms that I consider to be top
funnel in the current day and age and
some of the ones that I don't consider
to be top funnel and this will help you
understand how to get more customers and
what platforms to focus on to get more
customers so this should be a extremely
important video for most people we're
going to start with an explanation of
funnel marketing because just as a
review because some people may not
understand it and this is one of the
most important Concepts that you are
going to know in marketing so you draw
an ice cream cone and Ms paint and what
you get is you get a funnel here okay
and so you have to imagine your customer
exists here outside in this wide world
and what the what you want the customer
to do is you want the customer to
essentially go into your funnel right
this way so
um the top of the funnel here is going
to be all uh like where the customer
first finds you right so as you as you
create a funnel like this they first
find you like this and then as they
become more interested in your content
um they the the calls to action and like
the things they do become uh more
prominent
so like right here they're just finding
you this maybe is like a subscription
like you know they just try to subscribe
to your YouTube for free or they follow
you or something and then down here in
green is maybe like an actual
transaction where they decide to buy
your product or your service or
something right and then like down here
is like your most dedicated customers
who maybe follow like everything you do
would buy anything you make things like
that right it's going to be like less
than two percent of your customers
so the vast majority of people are going
to be somewhere in this cycle actually
everyone will be in the summer in the
cycle or they'll be outside of it so
what we are concerning today is only
this group right here
is this top of funnel and how to best
acquire those people which is often the
biggest problem that people have in
business it's the how do I acquire
people if you look at any tech company
or any
um really any company their problem is
what's called UA which is user
acquisition and that's what we're going
to be going over today okay basically by
social platform so this is a Time
relevant
um
video in the sense that like as of the
time of this recording which is October
about October 2022
this is like what is current and we'll
have to do update videos if this is uh
still not true so this is basically a
tier list and we're going to start with
a discussion about Tick Tock kind of to
just immediately provide value
the issue so Tick Tock is actually often
seen to be a top and funnel platform
keep in mind that if it's not on this
list if it's not in this discussion it
is not a top level platform if I don't
mention it that is not a mistake it's
deliberate so if it's not a top fun well
platform so let me be going over top
level platforms Tick Tock is a top
funnel platform so I again I Define a
top funnel platform just before we begin
top funnel platform is a platform where
a customer can hear about you for the
first time
and enter your funnel
so that means that there's programmatic
or automatic Discovery through that
platform of some kind
that can reasonably get you a good
amount of customers
tick tock is often seen to be the king
of
top funnel platforms
in this day and age
and I have realized that I do not think
it is a good top of funnel platform I
actually don't think it's a good
platform for running a business on at
all and I had I had a real weird Journey
with this realization because I started
just saying okay well Tick Tock is like
not a big deal and then I was like okay
Tick Tock is the big deal and then I
started actually running ads against it
I started experimenting I started get
doing all the stuff that I do in the
agency world where we look at Brand
accounts we look at people building and
we realized that the problem with Tick
Tock is that you get it's a really weird
system that's why I want to start with
it it looks like you get tons of views
Impressions follows and fast right it
just it just like picks up really fast
so it's not unrealistic to create
five to seven Tick Tock accounts post
the same content and then one of them
gets virality and you'll be like oh I've
got a video with like two million views
this is like really common
but the problem is that there's there
seems to be at least no follow-through
meaning that users don't
actually do anything
if CTA is called to action so for
example it's like they'll follow you but
as soon as you're like go buy this
product
or go follow the stream or go do
something else
go lower in the funnel basically
it doesn't seem like the vast majority
of users will do that now there are some
users that will and if you have a
million views on every single video
you're probably going to get enough
follow-through that it's worth it but I
think the I I think that the very high
amount of views
is a little bit of a fly trap because it
you seem to think that by building a
tick tock brand you can create a funnel
I'm not convinced that that's the case I
I think that for most businesses
Tick Tock is not a good top of funnel
platform meaning that you shouldn't
focus on it to acquire customers which
is why most people are using Tick Tock
right now so that's why I think I want
to start with this there's other
problems too though
um there's high views but not
monetizable views
so why is that well it's because the
cpms are very low for six second ads
right there's not a lot of ways to show
them you're interrupting a huge amount
of the content that the viewer wants to
see and it's intrusive whereas like in a
18 to 20 minute video you expect a few
ads and you can like take breaks in
between and still watch the content and
you have time for like a 30 second
mid-roll or a pre-roll that is going to
be a full-blown ad that even could be
like unskippable or even a skip wad
but you just don't have that kind of
time on tick tock
so cpms are naturally lower
and I don't think this is going to
change I think this is kind of the
nature of
um short form content I think YouTube
shorts also has this problem
and I don't think it's gonna get better
in the future because I don't think the
CPM problem is really solvable I think
it's just sort of again the nature of
short form content
so if you know this about tick tock
i i i there are use cases where
Tick Tock is is is great and that's kind
of worth mentioning that like top funnel
platforms can really be anything like
Instagram is not on this list but
Instagram could be a top level platform
for someone I just don't think it's a
very good one and not worth mentioning
so for the vast majority of people it's
not going to be useful but there is
someone that can build a whole brand off
of it right today
okay so I don't think so I think Tick
Tock right now is like C or D score okay
so like we'll just say score
uh C or D
right I think it's it's quite bad to
build top funnel on still possible okay
let's go into
um
some of the other ones now
all right so Facebook
I should say meta now meta is really
good
um I think meta is a b
and for politics it's an S highest
possible for 40 plus audience it's an a
and what I would say is don't
underestimate this platform pages are
very strong and Facebook groups
are under used
so
Pages individually are really really
strong on um and making a themed page
for whatever you're doing
is is especially if like you can if you
so like if you're trying to become an
expert or you have like a product that
like let's say you're selling
um there's like a person in The
Mastermind chat that sells uh dungeon
master type stuff for like Dungeons and
Dragons
that person should absolutely use a
Facebook page
um and and Syndicate content there
particularly if you're doing the Twitter
strategy which lots of people in this
community are right now because Twitter
is like unbelievable so Facebook groups
too already so you could create and lead
a group and then do calls to action to
it and you totally control the messaging
within that group so it's really
powerful and those people tend to be
this so what's really interesting is
like when you think about top funnel
marketing it's not just getting the
users in this funnel it's also how fast
they fall down it so in on meta Facebook
groups tend to make you fall down the
funnel really really fast they tend to
be very engaged users that are on
Facebook they spend a lot of time on the
platform and
um I would say that like I I put it at a
beat because
um it can be a little bit hard if you
don't know how to use meta to get users
whereas like for something like Twitter
the ease of use is just like making
really high quality threads and such
allows for like way better discovery of
your brand but Facebook what in the
hands of someone knows how to use it is
s and if you know
the if you know that your genre is
discussed there quite often so like
politics movies entertainment stuff like
that it is s plus it's so good and you
can build an entire brand off of meta
you can build an entire funnel off of
meta you can even build a page where
it's uh the entire funnel is contained
within the page where the top of funnel
is Discovery and then the bottom of the
funnel is AD revenue from videos you
upload and so you can even
um build just an entire business off of
meta or driving product or whatnot
so that is really good
um next we're gonna go to
uh let's talk about LinkedIn
LinkedIn
is
a
B to C
um but it's uh for expertise s
and for
um like industry or Authority building
it's s
so
you can actually build any brand on
LinkedIn not just professional brands
I've seen gaming work there I've seen a
lot of other stuff work there it works
fine but professional Brands obviously
and expertise like knowledge worker like
knowledge or thought leaders type things
work the best on LinkedIn
it's still to this day underutilized
even though I started talking about it
like 12 months ago longer maybe it's
still underutilized by content creators
there's still far more people consuming
content on it than there is
um making it and so that is always a
good sign that you could use this
platform so
um
if you're a professional like you should
be on LinkedIn
and
for people that follow me I usually
think that people should focus on two
platforms and three maximum
so if you're like a thought leader
writing LinkedIn is really really good I
might come back to this but those are
just my thoughts on it right now
okay let's talk about um Pinterest
Pinterest is a
um
B but uh female audience is S Plus
and fashion is S Plus
so Pinterest is
um amazing Discovery for stores
and fashion products or apparel jewelry
anything like that
basically anything within like a like a
female shopping demographic you have to
be on Pinterest you're crazy if you're
not on Pinterest this is such an
insanely good Discovery mechanism in top
funnel and again it's also a full funnel
that people fall down very fast like you
can discover a product on on Pinterest
then your your blue part is you go to
the website green as you convert and
like that can all happen in like five
minutes
and N happens perpetually with every
single fashion and apparel brand should
have a Pinterest page full stop it's
like crazy if you don't
for everything else it's not that great
you really have to think about if the
platform makes sense and you have like a
highly
visual product or service
I I think that a lot of people are
trying to make like clips
um let's say like gaming Clips or like
art or something like on that are it's
really good but like gaming Clips or
things like that
on like Instagram or like on like
Pinterest it just doesn't make sense
like like if it needs a direct
conversion need to direct funnel
conversion I don't think you can use
Pinterest for like something like
getting a bunch of followers somewhere
um
it's not a really good platform to build
like an influencer brand on like any
more than like Instagram is anymore
right
um it's a highly visual platform so it's
things like direct products or shopping
work really well there so keep that in
mind if you're trying to build a
Pinterest brand
okay next we're going to talk about
um
uh Cora
which is an a
uh core is insanely busted and and for
uh industry leaders it's an S Plus
so just answering questions in your
category
and
um answer it as many as possible
and then creating a profile
with a call to action
or ending your
answer with a CTA
quora and other websites like it any
kind of like ask websites the the real
strength of these websites and what
makes it an a is the SEO
so it's going to be just millions and
millions of people going or like what it
kind of depends on your category but
like at least like hundreds of thousands
of people that are finding your content
because
um the when you ask a question at Google
it ranks these questions so highly but
by the way Reddit is also an a tier for
this reason you can create threads
within your expertise and um that makes
it really really strong for influencers
uh like obviously like doesn't matter it
really like this is an F tier platform
for influencers you need to have a you
need to have like an expertise of some
kind you need to be
um a brand or like a company it's like
selling something to be really good on
quora right now
but it's extremely strong
for
experts and for people that are um
but not so much for trying to build a
community
okay so let's talk about
Reddit
uh reddit's also an a because of SEO S
Plus only fans or pornography
it's amazing just like insane
uh the model here is you post pictures
of yourself and then in your Reddit
profile you have like either only fans
or like ways to convert up many many
many many uh s tier Brands built on that
it's actually pretty good for
influencers too
um
it's also good for experts right it's
kind of just good all around you have to
post a lot High Time investment and you
have to post a lot of quality
but people will check you out and
they'll convert to your ctas based on
your profile
let's talk about YouTube
uh YouTube is asked here for everything
uh it is
the best platform to grow anything
and there are a few instances where
YouTube is not good for something
um
I almost can't think of one YouTube is
an unbelievable
service and platform
the algorithmic discovery is better than
any other platform on Earth it's
attached to Google which is the greatest
search engine on Earth
which also means your results and you
get SEO like Reddit and quora but better
um if you know how to make YouTube
videos you can build any brand uh if you
make YouTube videos and they're
consistently successful you can build
any brand off those videos like Jimmy Mr
Beast right like um chocolate brand
um
what else does he do uh Burger is right
like you could build anything off of
YouTube
furthermore though you also have a
community
which you can get high engagement
through Community posts
you have feedback loops through comments
you have
um
and you have detailed analytics that
tell you everything
and you have bottom funnel monetization
or full funnel monetization we should
say
where a person can literally donate to
you whether it be live or through video
a person can subscribe a person can then
buy a product and then highly effective
ctas
both live and through descriptions
nothing can beat YouTube YouTube is so
good nothing will ever beat YouTube as a
top funnel platform most likely it is
insanely good
and when you actually look at YouTube
and these reasonings these are a lot of
reasons why YouTube is so Superior that
a lot of people that are not marketers
don't think about so for example like on
Tick Tock doing a call to action through
a video description just doesn't matter
right like but I can actually link
things on my YouTube out and I know that
five to ten percent of my total views
are gonna go click that thing and go
watch it
um if I do a call to action in the video
and I tell people to go do this even
higher right so I can basically create
my My Own mid-rolls by doing something
like hey guys like check out my patreon
if right so so I can immediately send
people to bottom funnel or hey I'm
selling a product I'm selling green tea
or something go check out this product
boom back to the content insane
um there is almost nothing that YouTube
is not asked for pretty much the only
time you don't use YouTube is if you're
horrible at making videos in which case
like my advice would be get better at
making videos because YouTube is so
powerful
foreign
you can build and run an entire Empire
on YouTube
multi multi-million dollar Empire on
YouTube no problem
in almost every category it's so good
I can't stop talking about okay
um more as to your websites thanks for
talking about Twitter
uh Twitter is an s
and it's really strong uh we're gonna
talk about a couple of things within
Twitter that you've probably never heard
before
and the first one is Twitter spaces
so I currently was just part of what I
learned to be the third biggest Twitter
space ever it had about 8 000 people 8
10 or something it was about the game in
history I just hopped on
um
insane Discovery through Twitter spaces
running regular Twitter spaces about
your expertise will naturally
um increase your follower count by a
huge amount
also High Discovery threads so the
current meta on Twitter is long form
threads
basically posting like info or something
that's like useful uh I will show you
what I mean
because I do them
so on my Twitter here
uh
I did like this thread for example which
was just about creative revenue on
Twitch uh 900 retweets 8 000 likes and
then every other
individual
is it a thread here is like 900 900 700
so like as as you continue these long
form threads you get thousands more
engagement but basically off of the same
thing here's another thing that I posted
like last week a 600 7000 likes so this
is just like very high fidelity very
high information very on Trend like at
the time uh stuff that generates a ton
of actual engagement
then you can make calls to action within
your main profile so here I have two
calls to actually one is to my YouTube
and one is to Novo my agency
and then I also have a pin tweet that
shoots people over to anywhere I want
them to go I'm going to update this
really soon
um I'm waiting for some website updates
for Novo but I'm going to update this
Choice soon with better call to action
so there'll be like a patreon here maybe
maybe patreon maybe not I haven't
decided but but YouTube will be there
um Nova will be there and some calls to
action through like Discord for example
could be there you call so call people
wherever you want
um
engagement a lot of people another thing
they kind of underestimate with Twitter
is the algorithmic Discovery so
[Music]
um
if you make high quality threads that
engage people then the people that
follow you will see more of your content
similar to how YouTube works so in the
past like what's changed about Twitter
in the last like six to eight months is
that rather than just seeing like a
blind feed of what's Happening
um
you tend to see more things that you are
more likely to engage with
and so users hate this because they just
want to see
um like everything like but like Twitter
is serving you stuff that you're more
likely to engage with of course right
because that's the business
so
um actually like a a lot of like really
really amazing stuff
is um coming out of Twitter
and Twitter has become my number one
source of what's happening in the world
as well
um
the uh
Trends tab
that uh comes up
where you can show what's happening I'm
just going to pull it up real quick
is always relevant to what you're
interested in
so if I go here there will always be
stuff that's happening in gaming
and like here's like something like
phasmophobia thing that's like this is
like it's like going
and so uh you'll see a lot of Esports
news
and like what's happening just things
that I'm interested in personally so if
you set up your Twitter to follow people
on Trend you will always know what's
happening faster than any other platform
YouTube's good at this too
um and then once you know you can then
make content or respond via Twitter but
it keeps going so
um insane for easy beginning followers
from zero
by making enlightened comments on other
people's posts so just like this is like
Twitter's the best platform for
hand-to-hand combat where like you have
no followers anywhere ever at all you
are literally just like you put five
dollars into the Devon Dash patreon
You're like okay what the hell do I do
now you go on Twitter and you reply to
30 to 50 people a day and just put
highly thought out good comments in
there and then have calls to action to
your profile you will build a brand like
that's it
so
um then once you have those followers
you know you convert by like long form
based on what you've discovered
and then eventually once you have enough
followers use things like Twitter spaces
to drive discussion and discovery
and like just off the Twitter space that
we did last week
I've had multiple Brands and multiple
people reach out to me
for podcasts
um the other insane thing about Twitter
that a lot of people sleep on is
um media so uh in the last like
just with those two threads that I did
in the last like five days I've done
like wired Washington Post Bloomberg
CNBC uh I've had so many I've said so
many different public New York Times
I've had so many different Publications
that I've talked to
in just the last um like two weeks
because media tends to rely
on Twitter to get content likewise I've
been on Philip DeFranco multiple times
I've been on multiple like news
reporting just because people uh it's so
easy for those shows that are building
content their people go out and they
look for things that have the highest
engagement in categories and so if you
get up into like the thought leader Tech
uh territory of like Twitter it's so so
easy to reinforce your expertise and
it's insane for call to action to things
this is so if you look at my personal
strategy for what I'm doing for top of
funnel you'll see that I only use these
two that's not a coincidence right so
what would be my third one for what I do
right I do LinkedIn
um and I like some of this is going to
be personal preference as well so like
for me I just like CBA on Reddit I I
think it's like more of like a negative
feedback loop that I want to participate
in
foreign
I could also build a very successful
brand particularly if I was doing like
courses we ran into somebody that was
doing courses
the other time the other day on
Mastermind so
um
I should have told that person to do
quora because like I think he was I
think he's selling a Lightroom course
like you absolutely go through and
answer questions about like Lightroom
and like Adobe suit Like A Creative
Cloud product projects there and then
call to action to your course is very
effective for something like that so
um
obviously there's a million different
ways to Market that's like the whole
purpose of this channel so I haven't
like covered everything here even close
to it in terms of like everybody's
individual business right that's like
it's an infinite project we're just
we're always working on that
but
um based on your business you can find
two platforms to categorize yourself on
that uh will be highly effective and and
pretty much for almost everything you're
doing uh a split Twitter and YouTube
strategy
um
is is probably going to be effective for
almost everybody it's what I'm
personally using
and like the other thing too is like
yeah could I use quora LinkedIn
meta right and do more work sure but
like I I can build a brand very
successfully off of two platforms and I
and for people that know my marketing
philosophy
I'm very much in like the a thousand
true fans camp where I think that you
don't need a following of like 10
million people you just need people that
are dedicated
I mean I I actually like I'm in a
different Camp altogether because I
don't believe in monetizing customers
unless you like absolutely have to
um even this patreon started is like
kind of like just like a thing that uh I
wanted to replace my Twitter
subscriptions and I had no idea it would
get to this level and now I have to
cradle this for you because
um I feel like I have to provide value
but but like you know like like the
money is it's not about the money
Spider-Man right like because like for
me you know I'm running multi-million
dollar agency I don't care
um I I always liked monetizing via
business
versus customers
um
customers just just tend to have less
resources than like B2B so I feel better
about
um Robin hooding like a brand and
providing Great Value then I do like to
a customer it's harder to see like a
custom like I can track that Brand's
results I can make sure I did a good job
for them but with like a customer I I
never hear from you you also like maybe
there's people like just hating this
stuff I don't know
so anyway
um it's worth bringing up twitch because
um enough people will ask
so twitch is not top of funnel but the
problem with twitch is that uh it
started top of funnel so platforms
change over time like I I'll make this
list again in like six months and it'll
be different like um stuff won't be sa
whatever right it'll be different maybe
Reddit becomes the best platform because
of an update maybe LinkedIn because
significantly worse or it's definitely
better twitch used to be top of funnel
because you could basically start a
stream and people would discover you
right there and um this is how people
like soda pop in or like you know like
old ogs became very successful on Twitch
however twitch is no longer a top of
funnel platform you cannot start a
stream there and get discovered
um that's why it's not on this list
deliberately likewise Instagram for
example actually suffered the same
problem Instagram used to be a super top
of platform Pro it has actually moved
out of the funnel entirely there are
still ways to make lots of money on
Instagram for example like an apparel
product that uh like Hunter thieves does
this pretty successfully that converts
people to like a store type of thing
that's still possible people would ask
like where would I put twitch on the
funnel probably somewhere in the middle
but I honestly wouldn't include them in
the funnel at all
um I put no value into twitch as a
business platform I I think streaming is
a complete waste of time for any serious
professional and I'm and I'm not
exaggerating it's a complete waste of
time
it doesn't mean you can't build a
business off of it
but um you can always build a better one
on another platform that's that's that's
the thing to keep in mind
okay so Twitter and YouTube
um take the cake right now as the
absolute Kings of top funnel marketing
and for the vast majority of you
um you ought build your business keeping
one of these in mind
um
the people in Mastermind have had
nothing less than meteoric success
getting in Twitter
and one of the ways that I evaluate
success is like
are small creators substantially
building audiences in real time off of
these platforms and so for like Twitter
that's like an absolute yes
um
YouTube
the problem is like you can there are a
lot of bad YouTubers
so you can you can you can like pound
your head against YouTube
for
you know five years have like 300 to 400
videos done
and not have gone anywhere
and
I don't think the same thing is true of
Twitter that like sheer quantity even if
you're an idiot will get you something
so it's harder to fail on Twitter that
is on YouTube which is interesting
and and I actually think that the
rewards are pretty much like one to one
two like um
you could do the same level of calls to
action
the same level of like driving people to
newsletters or products or things like
that that you can do on YouTube ctas are
really strong and the discovery is
really strong
so yeah like right now like Twitter is
just like really killing it and the
updates they keep making like Twitter
spaces is a very recent thing is like
so good
um I think off of the Twitter spaces
that I did I got 3 000 followers
maybe more
it's really really powerful yeah okay I
think that's it
um this has been top funnel marketing
maybe we'll do another one of these two
lists for bottom funnel that'd be kind
of fun
and mid funnel but yeah for now that's
top funnel marketing how to get
customers thanks everybody let me know
what you think
