well hello there today we're going to be
talking about authenticity authenticity
is a word that you see tossed around all
the time in business right like we have
to be authentic with your customers or
well that person seems really authentic
but we're going to talk about what it
means to be authentic okay and it's
really important because within that
definition we're going to
outline some of the business practices
and values and even rules that i have to
uh come off as an authentic person which
i think most people would agree that i'm
an authentic person um or at least i
understand the definition of it after
this video okay so
authenticity overall is the sense that
the person that you're dealing with now
we're talking from a business
perspective right so authenticity is the
sense that the person that you're
dealing with is value driven towards you
and maybe even that they're value driven
towards above their own interests right
like not just value driven towards you
but value driven above their own
interest and there are a couple of
things that make you as a customer say
oh that person is that person seems
authentic this person seems like a
person i want to interact with and buy
from which is extremely important when
you're interacting with anybody that is
a subscriber or a fan or a product
person can buy your product or service
whatever and authenticity i think should
be at the top of your
kpis your your key performance
indicators for how you interact with
people as a business person you can't
always get it right but you should try
to be authentic if at all possible okay
so what are some of the components that
make people authentic let's start off
with um a couple cool ones so
i'll start off with a very obvious one
which is drive value first okay so drive
value first means that you should
be
interested in
delivering value to your customer beyond
basically all else now value can mean a
lot of things it can mean entertainment
it can mean education it can mean a
really kick-ass product it can be really
kick-ass service but at the core of your
entire thesis you should direct yourself
to to answer the question how do i make
the person who is on the other end of
this transaction really feel completely
fulfilled that they the the money they
have spent or the experience that
they're getting is is like 100 great how
do i how do i do that and then succeed
like like succeed in doing that try and
do that as much as you can being value
driven um
that is the first part of being
authentic is like really trying to drive
value first and i think the at the core
of business everything comes down to
driving value to your customer and that
is that may seem obvious to you it may
seem like i'm starting with the most
obvious one but most people don't
actually do this in practice what they
do is they
deliver a product or service with the
objective of making money or the
objective of getting something in return
from the customer and you'll you'll see
this in tons of businesses where the
business will be trying to generate more
revenue or trying to get more customers
or trying to get more followers or
trying to get more subscribers on their
youtube whatever it is instead of
driving value first means you do that
thing you drive value first before you
do anything else before you get
subscribers before you sell products
before you do anything you care about
that customer's experience that's the
first step of being authetic okay
the second part of being authentic is
along the lines of driving value first
which is do things that don't maximize
your initial roi okay
so how many sponsorships have i taken on
the youtube and the twitch stream since
2012 right zero i've never taken one
that's not i've gotten offered a ton of
them i've been offered tons of them for
tens of thousands of dollars i don't
take them because i'm very value driven
i want people to have an incredible
experience and unless the sponsor is
offering like a free product or they're
offering something that i feel like um
like genuinely helps my you my my um
my
the person that's watching me i will not
take that offer so
there are things that you will come
across lots of decisions
in business
where
you'll you'll get a lot of money up
front for doing something that you know
doesn't feel right and if you want to be
an authentic person
you need to say no to all of those
outright um and so a good example of
this would be like um
if you feel wrong about something but it
might have a very high upside like you
could have a casino sponsor or you go
into business with someone who you know
has a lot of money like um but you just
don't feel good about that partnership
don't do it right don't and instead
do things that drive value but don't
necessarily initiate uh um
cause initial roi and that drives me to
uh the next one which is number three
which is say no
so saying no
is
super important for any business person
saying no is
very different from
saying
nothing where most people will um
decline a business transaction or
decline working with someone
by
just not saying anything or not getting
back to them you should tell people no a
lot and
i tell people no constantly i also tell
people no in the face of potential high
amounts of revenue so if a brand comes
to me and they say hey we want to work
with you we'll offer you 500 000
um
tell us like who to work with and i
don't feel like i can drive value to
that brand i will say thank you but no
our agency can't provide you value
if a person comes to me and says hey i'm
a small content creator i'm willing to
shore up the 500 bucks an hour that you
charge um and i want you to teach me to
be a a better twitch streamer i will say
no to their money this is a very hard
concept for people to
uh to understand because they
so many people don't think in the long
term and don't realize like how to build
a like the authenticity has no price tag
that like
you
maintaining your virtue and your values
will make you into a rich and wealthy
person beyond any measure and you don't
need to like siphon from people who are
off or the quick fix or siphon from
people
or prey on people to get that saying no
is really important you should say no to
anyone or any customer or any client
that you do not feel like you can
provide value to i i really mean that
like if you feel like for any reason
that a person cannot get value from your
product and service and there will
always be a percentage of people in
every business that approaches you that
are willing to give you money but they
cannot get value from it you may know
more than them you tell them that you
say sorry but no we're not going to do
this because i do not feel like i can
provide you value and i literally have
that like it comes up so much more than
you might think i think i have that
conversation like at least once a week
on some call on some sales call or
whatever where i say okay like what are
you guys about they tell me it's a
potential client i say all right like
that's not something we can do like this
is not something that i provide like if
somebody comes in and says like hey like
um can you get me people on instagram
i'll give you a hundred thousand dollars
i don't really know a lot of people on
instagram i'm gonna say no like that's
not what our agency does we can hook you
up on twitch and youtube but like we
don't really know how to do that so like
like that's maybe a vertical i could
build later but i'm gonna be honest with
them and tell them that i can't do it
which brings me to number four which is
always tell the truth as you see it
that means that
when you're on a call with somebody
don't sugar coat things don't
about things tell them where they are
are not going to get value right so if
you have a a talk with a potential
client say these are the things that are
not gonna work like for example uh i was
on a call with a client yesterday and we
were talking about potential activations
on twitch that we could do through
influencers and they um they they threw
out a thing where they said well what if
we activate on this big streamer and i
said i straight up don't think that if
you give us that money it's gonna be
worth it like if you give us that money
to pay that big streamer it's just not
gonna be gonna come back to you in any
kind of roi that you're gonna be uh
impressed with and when you tell people
that that's the truth as you see it
that is that really establishes
authenticity with them and that also
brings me to number five which is um
don't be
needlessly professional
um
this is so important in so many aspects
of business i type with thumbs up emojis
i don't use full sentences whenever i
talk to clients i i work with coca-cola
hershey's sci-fi the us army i work with
all kinds of people and i'm never
professional
okay and and professional when i say
professional what i mean is i don't
i i talk like this i talk like i'm
talking to you right now i curse i say
things that i mean i tell the truth as i
see it and i'm not needlessly
professional i'm never going to be like
um well i understand your concerns and
like those are the very good points and
i want i never do corporate talk and i
hate corporate talk towards me uh i i
will also going back to number four
always tell the truth as you see it if a
person starts corporate talking with me
i'll be like hey i'm a really authentic
person um can we drop the and
have a great conversation about like
what our objectives are or i'll just
like stop a person that's talking
like a person will launch into their
corporate thing like well we here at
this corporation like really value
respect and inclusiveness okay stop like
what are your objectives what are your
kpis what do you want to accomplish
let's talk on that level right and i'll
always try to meet people on that level
uh because i i don't want to have these
conversations that are just like
 needless speak if i'm in a
meeting and um i uh have people being
this needlessly professional i will stop
the meeting and i will be like hey like
99 of what we're talking about right now
just doesn't matter and like like let's
restart get objective focused and like
i'll i'll drive people back on that so
um these are things that require a a
great deal of confrontation and not
everybody will be willing to work with
you so there will be people that will be
like man that guy's an like i i
wanted to have my like lame corporate
speak but that
the price of me sitting in another
dumbass meeting where for for 90 minutes
where i listen to someone rattle off on
 that doesn't move the needle
forward on anything it like i will is is
like my time being the most valuable
thing i will just not do that so i will
cut people off i will say hey can we
like focus on like x y and z and i'll
stay objective driven as much as
possible and again i will lose a certain
amount of clients doing that i will lose
a certain amount of relationships doing
that however
the c is very large and and and i will
save myself time and with the people
that matter i will drive respect because
they know that i am objective driven and
that like i'm trying to determine again
how to deliver value so uh that we're
going back to number one is like that
that drive value first thing right
like i drive value by cutting through a
lot of there's so much needless
 in the business world like
there's dumb meetings there's people
that want to have a call with you just
to like shoot things off like back and
forth there's like philosophizing and
then what-ifs and stuff like that just
like cut through all that right
and tell people as much
and you don't have to be needless to
professional um i don't
ever
wear
suits ever i never have worn a suit in
my life i never will
i i don't uh i i i don't like dress up
for people i don't attend useless
gatherings i just say things like they
are i want to drive value to people and
that's that's like all it is
okay
and um
number six then uh is uh
do what you actually commit to doing
so if you fail at number three
and you
do what you actually commit to doing
well if you don't want to do it
you shouldn't have said you shouldn't
have said yes to it in the first place
so actually go through with it and
commit to doing it so as much as
possible i try to do this i think i fail
at this one the most but i tr i always
try to commit like if i actually commit
to something i try to do it um a good
example of this would be
nope i forgot what i was going to talk
about so do what you actually commit to
doing
so
say like like say no to as much things
as possible but do what you actually
commit to doing okay and um number seven
is have a 100
money-back guarantee on everything
this is just like a very tactical thing
that you can have so no matter like
forever whatever product that i release
whatever service that i release
whatever thing that i do
uh there will be a 100 money back
guarantee on there always has been
if somebody buys my product and says i
don't like it whatever the reason they
just want to keep it for free i'll give
back the money it's no problem right and
the grand scheme of things no no problem
you have to trust other people that the
vast majority of people are good and if
they have received value from you um
going back to being driving value again
they will um not ask for a refund or
like well like um one of the things
about authenticity it keeps a lot of
people inauthentic is they think the
rest of the world is evil so they will
say they will justify their business
decisions by saying well other people
are out to get me so like for example
they'll say well i'm not going to do 100
money back guarantee because everybody's
just going to buy my product and then
they're going to refund it and they're
going to get the product for free nobody
actually operates that way i've had 100
money back guarantee for 15 20 years in
business and i and the number of refunds
that i have gotten have always been
reasonable uh even when i sold
absolutely dog products so you have
to kind of believe inherently in the
goodness of other people that they are
not going to screw you um
while at the same time guarding yourself
and maintaining that you have a certain
creed and that if people violate that by
um
by wasting your time with or
not being value driven that you have the
strength to step away from that to say
no and to maintain yourself
authentically to your own virtues so um
do what you actually commit to doing but
don't do what you don't commit to right
and and you should say no to most things
in business and um i i think in most
businesses at least 10 of clients are
people that you can say no to pretty
safely some of those people will then
kind of step back and they'll be like
hey like actually i sort of thought
about it and um i think we could work
together in this way right because once
you kind of establish that bastion of
strength and you say
and you speak what you mean
um people will start to respect you more
and i also i also often find that like
um
let's say a brand comes to me this
happened the other week and a brand
comes to me and says hey i've got ten
thousand dollars it's a massive brand by
the way these guys are multi-billion
dollar company i've got ten thousand
dollars i wanna do an activation on
youtube i said you straight up do not
have enough money to do an activation on
youtube and they said well this we're a
marketing department like we know what
we're doing i said no you don't know
what you're doing on on this platform we
know what we're doing and here's why and
i outlined the reasons and then that
brand actually came back to us and said
you know what like we're going to trust
you with this um like but we're going to
trust you with this we're going to give
you more money you'd just be so
surprised how often like it sounds like
i'm being an but i'm value
driven towards that brand i'm saying you
guys don't have the resources to
activate on a campaign like i can take
your 10k i said that right i can take
your 10k but it's good but i'm going to
give you a influencer who's not
who's tiny who's not gonna be able to
get the results that you want and you're
just gonna burn out of youtube thinking
that it's a thing and that you
wasted your time and money or i can tell
you this is what it's actually gonna
take to run the campaign that you expect
and you can either take that back to
your people or not and they gave me that
money at the end right right and now i
can do it because um i was just super
straightforward with them that i knew it
wasn't gonna work and i followed all my
principles and all my virtue and i
didn't take their ten thousand dollars
and and and look i i didn't tell them
that they needed more resources or they
needed to rethink the way they wanted to
the campaign with any intent of getting
their money or or any intent of making a
sale i told them honestly that that was
a that that i i didn't expect any kind
of sale from that at all right and it
would have been fine if that brand
walked away and they never worked with
me again i'm totally fine losing any
customer i'm totally fine losing any
subscriber i'm totally fine losing
anybody and being able to walk away from
anything there's a phenomenal quote in a
movie called heat
heat is a fantastic old movie with al
pacino and robert de niro and there's uh
a scene in it where one of the criminals
says if you're not willing to turn your
back and walk away from something in 30
seconds you don't have a wife right like
that's how i look at everything it's
like like i i will
walk away from anything that doesn't
feel right from anything that doesn't
seem like i can provide that true value
but man if i'm
linked in if i'm connected with somebody
i will i will desperately try to provide
that person value
i'll do everything i can so
every single person that's watching this
video right now i'm desperate in this
video to provide value there may be some
of you who eventually stop giving me
money that's fine right like um you have
to
stay it's like the authenticity thing is
about staying attached
like i'm desperate to provide you value
and that's what i'm attached to that
that that value but i'm not attached to
you right i'm not attached to that
individual customer it doesn't matter if
an individual customer is 50 of my
company's revenue right now knowing
knowing my philosophy on this like i'll
diversify so that never happens but man
i will i will 100 be driven towards
value but you've got to let go of like
anybody's power over you and that's what
makes you an authentic person and people
will read into that so i i think if at
all possible
going back to it
you should
never blame
customers
for their decisions to not support you
or to withdraw their support from you
if a customer is withdrawing support
from you they either weren't right for
you or you are not providing that
customer value and you have to
understand that you cannot i mean cannot
provide everyone value there is no
business in the world that can some of
the best businesses in the world like
amazon have a large basis of people who
hate them right like revolutionary
businesses like microsoft or apple have
people who will never buy their products
you cannot please everyone you can't
please everyone so stop trying to give
your energy out to other people
and focus your energy on the people who
will not like you when that is a
guaranteed percentage probably 10 to 20
percent of the people you interact with
especially if you're a brand will just
not like you they won't vibe with you
you don't have the right energy whatever
the your haircut's bad whatever the
 the reason is okay like focus on
the value you can drive internally to
yourself is this something i'm releasing
right now that
means
that is important right i like a lot of
videos
you you see i i they never go to you
that i i film them and then i'm like you
know what that's dog i don't want
it in the world and i don't put it out
right like um
i only put out stuff that i really think
is going to provide value to people and
i i stay from that position and i really
care that it does but if a person comes
to me and says hey like i don't like
your funky haircut i'm withdrawing my
hundred dollars a month for for your
believers here i go cool man like that's
i i don't ever sweat i don't ever lose
any sleep over that and i don't take
that into myself as like a flaw on my
character and i just continue to try to
provide value and as long as you stay
value driven i promise you those people
will come i promise you but as long as
you like don't trust the world you don't
trust other people you you you believe
that people are out to get you um you
believe that you need to have the money
first you think that you need to
monetize you think that you need money
you think that money is like the the the
thing that you need like you're like
it's not it's mindset it's authenticity
okay so
these are some of the things that i
i don't know this is a very convoluted
video but i hope that it makes sense
because ultimately
you have to think about
who you are
as a brand and a business
your your business is an extension of
you and your brand is an extension of
you
and you should have a very clear picture
of
who you want to become
and you should set out
your rules and virtues for what you will
not do and people will respect you
for that even if they disagree it's
really important that you stay true to
yourself above all else
because you're not true to yourself how
can you expect to be true to anybody
else so hope that is a good video and
thanks let me know bye
