hello
this is part one of an ongoing series
about expertise and becoming an expert
this is something that i think that
every single person regardless of
whatever you're doing can benefit from
and that is why i wanted to turn this
into my first series that i've ever
talked about so we're gonna start with a
concept that you could probably be
charging more
than what you are doing now and this is
going to be
a co-produced video with another video
coming up which is what is an expert
because i think both of those will kind
of like cover what this is so
you could probably charge more than you
think you can what do i mean by that
what i mean by that is
um
very often i have
people who come to me and they say i'm
very nervous to charge for my services
believe it or not like although we
perceive most business people to be like
trying to get all the money they can
most people are really self-conscious
and they they think that they can't or
don't deserve to earn as much money as
they should uh this is particularly
something i see in women all the time
where they should earn way more than
than they actually uh think they should
and i'm going to tell a story uh that i
thought was really fascinating so
a while back in seattle i'm looking for
cleaners
and i'm trying to like go through
different cleaners and different prices
and i see this one guy that's like the
highest rated on the platform
i'm going through all the cleaners
different pictures and stuff
and uh this guy's named mr queen and
he's got like this big bright smile bald
head like
african-american gentleman just like
looks fantastic
like holding up a cleaning bottle and
this guy's prices are three times more
than anybody else around him
but he's the most popular person on the
platform like what's going on right and
that is actually where i want to start
with experts there isn't the service
that he provides isn't meaningfully more
impactful or effective than anybody
else's house cleaning services house
cleaning is pretty straightforward so
what he's doing is he's creating what is
called a signature service in marketing
a signature service
means something that
defines you from all of the other people
in your space
via branding marketing
or a different look okay
i just came up with that definition
right there but it's basically signature
services
so
when
i say you could probably be charging
more than you think you can
what i mean by that is the customer is
usually willing to pay
well no the customer is always willing
to pay
more than you think
if you are able to get into the
customer's head about why you can
demonstrate that value even if your
service doesn't change
so
for example
i've done a lot of work on this now
but i i used to charge about 150 to 200
an hour kind of depending on on what
the uh topic was for consulting and i
charged 500 an hour now and i raised my
prices that i didn't lose a single
customer in fact i gained customers i've
heard the story over and over again and
nothing particularly changed at all but
my signature service is if you need
media consulting on either on either
esports or
building
um in a content creation brand or an
entrepreneurship oriented brand or your
company is trying to get into esports or
or those gaming industry verticals like
i'm your guy right like that's my
signature service there probably isn't
anyone else doing active consulting in
the space that that has the esports
knowledge that i have certainly i mean
you can't point to a single person who's
built a an lcs to your esports team
right and that's my signature service
now you might be thinking well that's
great devin thanks for making a video
talking about how you run an esports
team how the hell does that help me okay
so
you have a
series of expertises that you don't see
right now as signature services um
but you have them
and and you have to go back through your
portfolio and and really figure out what
those are and that's part of the purpose
of this series is we're going to talk
about how to do that and like how to
actually eventually set yourself up as
an expert
like later on we'll talk we'll go
through and like we'll do some uh
basically like some sops on like how to
build out like an expertise profile and
and convince other people that you are
one but the reason why i'm starting with
you're probably more worth more than you
think is because before you convince
other people that you're an expert you
have to convince yourself that you're
one and that's a bigger challenge you
may think
um
i i i be we had a really interesting
conversation in the patreon mastermind
chat where somebody came in um that said
hey like i i i've been in this industry
for quite a while i'm starting
consulting services i'm they were kind
of way under charging um i think it was
in trucking and and they said um
uh
you know i i'm kind of nervous because i
i don't feel like i have this expertise
and it's like
you absolutely have that expertise
because the way to think about this is
if you if you focus on something uh for
30 minutes a day even right much less
several hours a day
the amount
of
ground that you'll gain on that subject
is so much that even after a couple of
months or weeks of focusing on that you
will be able to charge for that service
simply because most people are not able
to enter the mind of a customer or
really think externally about how much
people know and this is actually
something that surprises me very often
that even incredibly basic concepts
about youtube or twitch that i cover
endlessly um here right
such as like affiliate is an is an
absolutely worthless thing right like on
twitch like the affiliate title
it
literally provides no benefit right uh
or um you can put an advertisement at
two minutes in a youtube video and
you'll always get the pre-roll revenue
and it will up your revenue on youtube
by 10
right like these are things that are
extremely straightforward that nobody
knows because i just came across it in
some esoteric uh
like weird way or i research it i focus
on it right and this is something that
um
that particular one on the youtube
revenue thing was from jeremy gaming
korea who teaches me a ton of stuff so
other people can help with this too but
you would be surprised how low the bar
is for a signature service
sometimes it's nothing um
like uh it's just a certification or
something like that i'll tell some
stories about that later right in like
another video
but the takeaway here is
once you've defined your skill
you would do well to do as much research
impossible just to find out and talk to
other people about what they really know
about that subject because you i i think
you can really provide value whether it
be like even like cooking or baking or
whatever like the way that you develop
your signature service is going to be
what you um
end up being able to charge okay so i
want to cover
two different things entrepreneurs and
employees
starting with entrepreneurs because
we're uh we're in that topic i'm i'm
gonna tell you how you can charge more
for both of both of you entrepreneurs
and employees starting with
entrepreneurs okay so first of all do
people say you're under charging
wow uh i can't believe the service oh
that's so cheap right when when i um was
doing computer repair i was charging 50
bucks an hour and i would do two hours
and give someone 100 bucks and i get the
comment um oh that's like so reasonable
right like that's immediately when you
should red flag that you're under
charging like you're your customer is
telling you to charge them more
and you're not doing it because in my
case this is when i was a young
entrepreneur i was very nervous about
charging right i was like really nervous
about charging money to people i didn't
want to do that
so
you you'll probably run into that same
problem or already it's that same
problem so is the customer telling you
to charge more right second thing is um
did you check your market so are you on
upwork are you on thumbtack right uh
and all these other platforms like
platform services
what are people charging are you under
them right then that's something that
you might want to consider too
oftentimes you might be right and their
rates are just posted right there it's
super easy to see what kind of uh
services you're providing uh in terms of
that um and then another thing you could
do and this is kind of a really cool
concept um
could you
double your revenue
but you'd lose half your customers
so let's just say that you have
uh
50 30 to 50 existing clients okay you do
physical therapy i'll do pt right like
i'll just
come we'll make it easy numbers like uh
so you have 30 clients you do pt
so you announce to all of your clients
you have a newsletter or something that
you're going to double your revenue you
expect to lose 50 of them would you take
that deal i would take that deal in an
instant
right i cut my work in half i i doubled
my revenue and i only have to deal with
15 people instead of 30 people right so
you probably the real answer though like
the actual answer you probably won't
lose the um
half your customers like maybe if your
prices are absurd like a thousand
dollars an hour for pt like you'll lose
a lot of customers but like as long as
you're within the realm of like reason
and you you explain to people why the
prices are going up 100 price increase
is not unreasonable like hey i was
charging 30 bucks an hour i'm turning 60
now because
times are tough i'm doing better um more
clients are coming in i'm working harder
and i know more right my expertise is
worth more
and that's a that's the thing that um
starting with this talk about expertise
i want you to keep in mind this is going
to be an ongoing theme through the
series which is that um expertise is not
a static thing if you've charged 50 as
an electrician for the last 10 years
you're messing up because you should
expect that your expertise increasing
over time as you
work on and develop that craft is going
to also increase the price that you have
right um at infinitum really right um
and you say well how could you be an
electrician charging a thousand dollars
an hour well contracts right military
contracts government contracts things
like that there's tons of ways to do
that right like you just you expand your
business in that direction get employees
things like that leverage other people's
time
so your expertise should be increasing
with your with your revenue and these
are things to think about as an
entrepreneur um
there might be a cap at some point like
i i would say
if i if i really go hard after i sell
this company i'll probably
double or triple down on content
creation and consulting at that point
i'll probably cap out at
a thousand dollars an hour because that
is the price that uh
i i think i ultimately want to sit at
and provide value at uh and that's fine
obviously right um then i might do some
like border advisory deals for some
passive income per month or whatever
but uh thank you to the thousand dollars
an hour just just for what i'm doing
the the thing i want to convey to you is
that
the
number that you have in your head should
be very high so you might be thinking
like oh like i can cap out at a hundred
dollars an hour no no no definitely not
like uh at least 500 an hour more than
that shouldn't be thinking about that so
here's the three questions i would say
for entrepreneurs that you should really
think about um you could like for most
entrepreneurs listening to this you
could likely just increase your prices
right now
uh with absolutely no downside
the the vast majority of people that
i've advised to do that no every single
person i've ever advised to do that has
has never um come out on the bad end of
that okay but let's talk about employees
so
for the people that are working
what uh what can you do to charge more
because it's like okay well it's great
if i'm an entrepreneur and i have a
service i i would say as an employee
right if you go back through this video
and you think okay what is the signature
service i can provide you might find out
that as an employee on your off time you
could also provide a service where all
this would apply so there's something to
think about there but i'm just going to
talk about your job so first of all
super stupid question can you ask for a
pay raise
right um can you just go ahead and ask
for one hey like uh i've worked here for
a while um i i feel like i'm providing a
lot of value trying to learn like uh can
i can i can i get paid more like what do
you think about that this is one of the
most uncomfortable questions that
um is in the working world and it's one
that uh people use or leverage business
owners leverage all the time that we
hope you won't ask but um if you do ask
it we need to have an answer the answer
is that you're fired obviously right um
if it is you weren't supposed to be
working for that company and and you did
yourself a favor believe me
business owners they don't want what
business owners don't want you to know
they don't want you to know like you
could ask for a pay raise any time
right and and that
asking for a pay raise like every six
months or so if you are providing
increased value and you can demonstrate
it
is reasonable and fine and the worst
they can tell you is no and you can also
pad that response you come in and say
hey i i don't want to be uh it's kind of
nervous for me to do this just say that
right like be vulnerable uh
but
uh i i feel like i provide a lot of
value to the company
my expenses and my quality of life are
are going up i i would love to uh work
for the company in a more integrated
fashion is there a way we could figure
out how to get a period you just ask for
one um
i'm a fan of that but i'm also
a fan of the second part of this
question which is um okay can we set
up objectives timelines goal posts right
that we both know
that would result in a promotion
etc right so
one thing you can ask your employer
if you're not comfortable with this
question or you've asked it recently or
you are just not in a position where you
think you can get a pay raise
the right question to ask your employee
is you're sorry your employer your boss
is okay
what would have to be true
for me to be able to
get a higher level position in this
company okay um what would have to be
true for me to get a promotion is it
certifications is it knowledge is it a
demonstration or a certain uh success is
it increasing revenue for the company by
a certain percent what are those things
right and get them on paper and get them
to figure it out and your boss should be
able to tell you well yeah if you were
able to accomplish this in three to six
months i think it would be realistic
that we could propel you and then go
accomplish it right and and by the way
everything you do as an employee will
become more effective because
you have a goal and most employees don't
actually have goals
in a weird way unless they have very
good managers and then those managers
set those those goals for them but
employees should all be able to set
their own goals and uh tell managers
what they are and this works at any
level of job if you are a barista at
starbucks and you want to become a shift
manager it's completely reasonable to go
to the franchise manager of that store
and say how does this how does this
what kind of qualities do shift managers
have
um
what what kind of time frame like i i i
like working here start there right i
like working for you and i want to step
it up and i would love to know how um
you evaluate shift managers and the
people that you promote what are those
qualities and how can i embody those
qualities and could we set ourselves up
on a on a track
over however many months um where we
work together to evaluate
the the progress that i'm making to get
to that level
and
you will be by having that conversation
on in a completely different universe
than anyone else working there the
number of people
that have actually had that conversation
with me
is very small
even though i make [ __ ] youtube
videos talking about this
uh and they watch them i know they watch
them okay like it's clg everybody
watched my my videos and one guy was
like i'm gonna go ask him to charge more
and he got over the course of like a
year and a half as one of my assistant
coaches
got like two pay raises and and had like
a uh
uh a direction like uh and sometimes you
didn't always hit it it's fine right
like it doesn't set you up to fail
but for employees there is numerous ways
you could probably just ask for a pay
raise right now
but if you want to go in and you want to
like make it like a mutual thing
you see how asking for more money in the
second example
literally also endears you to the
company even more like look at like all
those buzzwords i just said you go back
and like like like
listen to how those words work right
where it's like hey like love working
here love working for you i want to step
it up man like i want to do more like
what could we what can we work on
together like what are the qualities
that you evaluate in a successful
manager or what do you need what kind of
problem can i solve for you then go
solve it for free go solve it for for uh
go do the thing that everybody [ __ ]
about on reddit go go work for go work
and solve that problem in your company
for free after you've had that
conversation don't do more work
that nobody asks you to do don't do more
work
and then present it go have the
conversation what problem do you need
solved
and then okay i'm going to try to solve
that problem
hopefully you get a timeline or
objective or goal post out of them like
oh can i get a promotion if i solve this
problem what do you think would happen
if i solve this problem um but if you
don't go do it anyway and then be like
hey boss came back solve that problem
and that pretty cool what else you got
right and
most people uh
like a lot of people in the internet
world think that that's a way to enslave
yourself to the big sea and
um
work for people
that will not be grateful for your
contribution
and in my experience and the experience
of of those that i have
worked with mentored or have mentored me
um which the latter of which is much
more significant like [ __ ] sea level
people at tech companies that is never
the case where it's like oh good my
employee is working twice as hard on
problems that i need solved i am glad
that guy is doing that i will now sit
here and nobody thinks that way as a
manager nobody thinks that way as a
leader they go that guy i need that guy
to lead a team right like if i have a
person who is solving huge amounts of
problems in my company i need i need
that person to lead a team of other
people to solve that problem even better
or to solve new problems that's how i
think right because i don't want i i
like as a business owner i want the most
effective people in my company possible
as a as an owner of a starbucks i still
want the most effective people possible
i don't want a shift manager that shows
up half the time it smokes weed but uh
like behind the back of the of the thing
i want the guy that gets there at 5am
works hard and communicates with me
why would i why would i um why in any
universe as a business owner i've never
understood these anti-work people that
don't get this like why as a business
owner would i ever abuse that person
that that person is is literally
outperforming everybody else on my team
and like i would never i would never do
that
if you are like a middleman if you're
under like a middle manager
who doesn't value your work and you
legitimately can like prove out that
there'll be some of you listening to
this that this is true for
right you can legitimately prove out
that
that's happening
where sometimes you get a middle manager
who's not attached to the company or the
outcomes and doesn't care you need to
you either need to get up above him
which which is a whole nother topic or
you need to get out right it's very rare
though like like for the the vast
majority of anybody that has skin in the
game that's that's actually tracking
objectives and is accountable and cares
about their job will always value high
performing people and especially people
to communicate with them so employees
that's how you raise your prices and
entrepreneurs that was how you raise
your prices for what i mentioned before
so okay so that's part one part one is
how you could probably charge more than
what you're what you think you're worth
more than what you think
and that was why and so i'll see you
again for the part two series which is
going to be on how to be an expert okay
or what is an expert that one then how
to be an expert okay bye
