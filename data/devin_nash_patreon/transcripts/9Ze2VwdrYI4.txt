okay hello today we're talking about
building businesses specifically in the
context of whether you should build a
business by yourself or with a partner i
have done both so i'm going to give a
little bit of history on it and tell you
where i ended up and some of the best
practices that i've learned along the
way this is a very good question and
kind of a cool topic so
there are different considerations for
solo business versus partnership pros
and cons to both obviously and we're
gonna go through that now so my history
is my very first business i ran was an
ebook company i ran this solo and that
was when i was 16 years old and i sold
books on
google
web pages
via adwords
uh so basically i i just say on web
pages via google adwords is the right
way to say that because they were my web
pages that i would set up and then the
second thing i did was i ran a marketing
company this was also solo
and this was with four employees
and then eventually
um
i uh
sold this for a very small amount of
money
i was a little bit older then and then i
actually ran an i.t services company
this was also solo
had two employees
and then after that um the next i did a
bunch of stuff but the next like real
company that i ran was clg that was a
partnership
eventually had 105 employees
and then we currently run which is nova
which is also a partnership
which uh currently has i think 17
employees
okay cool
so
i'm gonna talk about kind of like
everything in the context of of these
companies and sort of my experience with
them so the e-book and marketing and iot
services companies were all kind of
individual operations in the sense that
the e-book company was just me building
web pages for for a product and then i
would go out and i would talk to doctors
and i would have a conversation with
them and say hey like add a page to my
book i'll write a book uh i'll write
like information down so things like i
focus on health so stuff like
um
knee pain was one of them i did like
bronchitis chronic barcara stuff like
that i'd have a doctor write like one
page of the book and then i would go
write the rest of it so very solo
enterprise i set up the website myself i
would run the google adwords myself do
the payment processing myself super easy
everything even easier today than this
was then this was like in 2000
or something that i did this so this is
like really beginning adwords it's so
much easier to set up these pros like we
didn't have paypal we'd like we had to
use authorize.net there was like so many
different things marketing company this
is for traditional advertising so i just
went around to businesses and said hey
do you want to do better advertising um
i can help you do that and they say yeah
and then i would um just do like digital
uh sorry non-digital print marketing
stuff like that um for like magazines
for like a health of health companies
had very few clients i.t services i just
did um
solo
also i would just uh put out ads
everywhere and i would teach classes at
a local um old folks like like uh like
retirement home and i would get clients
that way and eventually just had the
employees were just people going out and
uh doing the same job i was doing but i
would just have them do it i would
basically source the clients so the
reason that i kind of give you a little
bit of history on this before we begin
on like what
uh the considerations are for this is
because
i generally think that solo enterprises
are better
served
when you are
doing something small you're selling one
product you're selling a service you're
selling maybe something that's like a
not very complicated software as a
service project generally speaking like
your business doesn't have a ton
of different avenues to it so if you go
through the
history of very successful companies you
will find both solo and partnerships
like there's a pretty even distribution
so
there are complicated companies that
were started by solo people i'm i'm
speaking in general and i don't think
it's a very good idea to compare
yourself to like uber or airbnb or
whatever you're not airbnb right like
you might have been found with two
people you might be founded with six
people it might have been one person
using those examples aren't too good uh
so so what i'm speaking of is like
generally when you are an individual
building like a pretty simple service or
web page that doesn't have a lot of
complicated nuts and bolts it's
generally better to go solo now as i've
evolved as a business person hopefully
evolved i've come to it i've come to the
realization that partnerships are
generally a better way to go to build
serious businesses so let's talk about
why
and then i'm going to give you some
considerations to think about as to like
the different sort of ways you could
think about partnership and and i think
that will help contextualize everything
so partnerships i think some of the huge
benefits of them
are um that you're not going to have
every skill set
okay and generally
a good partnership
involves distribution of skill sets
so what do i mean by that um
it means that you should focus on both
of your strengths so for enovo for
example is a good example um for me
right now i manage marketing uh all
sales
i do
most of the like user acquisition almost
all of it
and i do a lot of like company direction
or like future pro planning okay and
then my co-founder matt
is
finance
technology cto type stuff
um
and account management
but
we come together
on
content um
brand
acquisition
and
uh decision making
which i'll get back to in a minute
so
um in
in in my partnership with matt for novo
uh i i am clearly the best at marketing
out of both of us it's not even close
right and when it comes to technology
he's clearly the best when it when it
comes technology it's not even close
like the same with like all of these
categories so you want to find a partner
who is going to comp so there's a big
debate and even in the mastermind chat
which is what genesis this video
there was a debate it's like do you find
a partner that complements a lot of your
skills or do you find a partner that
contrasts them and in my experience you
always try to find a partner that has
contrast these skills
that supplement your weaknesses or
complement your weaknesses i would say
so um if you're very very good at
programming in technology you might need
to find a person that's very good at
marketing if you're incredibly good at
marketing in sales you might need to
find a person that can make your product
better right you have to you have to
make these different
um kind of assessments as you as you go
along with the um
with a partnership and um
both of the businesses that i've
successfully run as a partnership so clg
which started with george uh the hotshot
gg is something you might know him
um
at the at clg i had a very different
role so i was very much the the
executive in the literal sense of the
word sclg i was i was making sure things
get done and i was designing what should
get done and george was like the big
vision
guy right so like like here's what i
think should happen next and he was so
good at that right and so we split the
work based on those strengths
um i also think that motivation
is better with a partnership
and i think this for several different
reasons one is like it's super important
to show up as a real
business okay um most people are not
really
building a business
but they think they are
so
the hallmarks of like a real business is
like do you have an office do you have
times where you come to work is there a
definable product or service that people
can buy right now is there a
um
is is there a way to engage with this
business is not just an idea in
someone's head and all these things are
made better by a partnership because it
requires two people to be invested in an
idea
and making something happen
at a ground level it's much easier to
like when you you add people to your
business like okay well how am i gonna
like house these people is it gonna be
remote work are there gonna be
expectations are there sops like
standard operating procedures are there
you can see i have a video about that if
you wanna go look at like what sops are
um motivation usually is better and you
tend to want to work more
this has been really helpful to me at
novo in particular where i don't think i
would be individually motivated i might
go on like a path of exile binge for two
months if it wasn't for matt and the
other people now that we have that are
working here where i will show up and i
will actually start working just because
i know those people are working and then
i'm sure that motivation carries over to
him as well right where he sees me
working on projects and and we motivate
ourselves in that way so i think it
helps build a more
serious
partnership um i do think there are some
advantages to solo um and i also think
there's some weaknesses
um
in seoul you get your exclusive vision
so so no one can really challenge it
and you also um and i think solo works
much better
in simpler
sas products
or
you know software as a service or
service businesses
like independent contractors things like
this are really good solo where um
you're not trying to scale to like a
huge degree
okay
and uh
i think the
the the last thing i really want to talk
about here is i want to
get
i'm basically going to contextualize
this video in this in a series of
questions that i think will answer the
rest of like all the topics around this
these are questions that you should ask
yourself like as you're going into a
partnership so so the first the the
first and probably most important what
is ownership distribution
right um
who owns what percent
and what votes
now there is a ton of debate on this i
am a huge fan of 50 50. most people are
not huge fans of 50 50. they're not fans
of 50 50 because they think that in the
event of a tiebreaker who actually is
going to win and my argument would be
that if you've set up your business and
your decision making and your
departments
in a way that creates tiebreakers you
already have a fundamental problem so
most people say don't do 5050 because
and somebody should be like 51 to be the
ultimate um
the ultimate like decision maker but i
don't think that creates a true equal
partnership where both people are
equally motivated i think it creates a
boss employee dynamic that is unhealthy
so in the same way and i don't like
power dynamics in companies um i don't
like them even between like people that
run companies like if i'm a c-level
executive and i have an employee i don't
like to think of that person as like an
employee while it's technically true i
like to think of them as a member of a
team with their own agency and decision
making and i i give i empower everybody
to be able to do that now some people
they they can't um
they they show that they can't actually
most people actually show that they
can't actually have that kind of agency
which is maybe a topic for another video
but uh
at that point you have to change your
management style and be a lot more micro
managing unfortunately a lot of people
are like that but
that shouldn't be your partner your
partner should be a person who is equal
or greater to you
like in the case of matt or george these
are these are my uh easily superior to
me in most things and equal to me and
others so um the ownership distribution
being 50 50 creates a healthy power
dynamic and then
what i would say is the way to solve
disagreements
is you
assign departments to each other
that you own so so so there is no
disagreeing with me ultimately in
marketing right like if it comes down to
it and i say something's going to go in
the marketing side of our business
that's that's just how it goes now
because of the way that we structured
our partnership um
we've never really run into that problem
but if we uh if we did it would come
down to departments
furthermore employees are are put into
certain departments so we have people in
sales we have people in finance and
account management and the um
the person who who runs that person is
always going to be one person so we call
those dr's or direct reports you direct
report to a single person so people in
sales direct report to me people in
account management direct reports matt
and yeah um i can interact with the
people in account management ask them to
do things i mean i'm still like
technically a boss
although i don't like that word but i'm
technically a boss
um
even though
i'm uh i'm technically a boss i don't
generally like
keep track of what they're doing or uh
have traditional meetings in in any
sense of the word um i just like that
would be the job of that oh like i
wouldn't have like a weekly meeting or
do any kind of like improvement plans or
anything with that person so employees
are are segmented to prevent
disagreements
um the next question you want to ask is
is what jobs and responsibilities
does each partner have
i think this kind of goes into the
department so i sort of explained that
how much time
will each partner
put into this business
this is a really great question because
um you need to to up front say okay what
are my expectations for time if you're
building a serious business
and you're going from the start
you're going to have to build that
business from the ground up and it's
going to require like six days of your
time and multiple hours of your time
like eight to 10 hours a day no problem
and ideally you're doing that in an
office together where which i i think is
the best for partnerships
um and also solidifies that you're the
most serious and you're committed about
it so make sure that your partner and
you both understand
what that time commitment is going to be
and that you're going to do it
um
how much investment or you know money
would you put
would each partner
contribute
so if it's going to be very simple if
it's 50 50 it makes it easy you know
okay we're going to start up but we
think we can start this business with
50k you know we put in 25 super easy
how will general business decisions be
made
this goes by department
pretty easy
um
how will serious disputes
be resolved
so this um
is good to put in like writing or good
to figure out uh usually if there's like
a serious dispute um
you would have like kind of a mastermind
where you both sit down and discuss the
pros and cons and come up with a
decision
it's really rare when you're
when you've discussed
one of the things i really believe is a
little bit tangential but one of the
things i really believe about like all
relationships and like all partnerships
marriage and relationships are a form of
partnership i've been in a lot of
long-term relationships you need to set
the ground rules really early and and
you need to be able to tell a person
like every relationship that i'm ever in
like the first date i'm like i am a
super crazy worker like i spend hours in
the office if you're not okay with that
like we don't have to do anything else
like we have to go any further and i've
never actually been rejected on that
basis which is amazing because i don't
think that women really know what
they're getting into until they like
really know that i'm serious about that
right i i can work you know 10 12 15
hours a day absolutely no problem seven
days a week it's harder for me to take
that time off um
than uh
that it would be otherwise so so i think
a lot of serious disputes just get
handled at the beginning right and and
and your interview process for a partner
an employee or a relationship should be
pretty extensive and it should be it
should involve questions like you know
um how are we going to be spending money
in this company um what what happens if
x y and z happens like um what are your
general philosophies on money like like
what do you believe on in spending money
and taking risk um how like like what
kind of time commitment is there going
to be here um like what are your
circumstances for getting up what
getting out what is your exit strategy
right one of the big things that i think
matt and i align on is that we both have
like a three or four year window for an
exit strategy with novo and george and i
had the same exit strategy as well we
wanted to sell to a bigger east bigger
team um and you know we made that happen
so having the same exit strategy is
really really important if if your
partner wants to leave in a year
and be done with the business and you
want to be done after scaling and
selling at five years you have a real
problem right that's an incompatibility
you need to identify like before you get
into things
um likewise like that kind of leads into
like what happens
if one partner
wants to
leave the business
right um what happens to the equity does
it fold into you does it does it does it
um do they get a payout depending on
like different cash like what happens
there right
um
that's really important like what's that
what's that person's exit strategy um
what is each partner's philosophy
on debt
and who takes it on
so if you're gonna take on like a
hundred thousand dollars in a loan to
run a business
um
what uh what considerations are there
for that and again 50 50 makes it very
easy you know you just both take
50
of the loan
um what happens if a partner dies so you
want to have what's called a dno
insurance director and officer insurance
which kind of um uh
makes this uh negligible in your
corporate bylaws basically um you know
so there's like a payout to the business
via insurance if somebody dies which me
it could keep running um if you want to
bring on additional partners what's the
equity distribution it's very important
right
um
and also in terms of eso's so employee
stock options how much equity
are we both going to sacrifice
uh to eso right 10 to 20 of your total
equity usually
uh again 50 50 split makes this really
easy
um
can partners work
on any other company
besides this one
and i generally say no
i think that partners should focus on
this as a main endeavor i.e you know 50
plus hours a week
but
can have side projects both matt and i
have like side income projects that uh
to some extent contribute to the company
and to some extent don't
that's fine but the vast majority of our
time is spent on the company likewise
what are your vacation requirements
recreational requirements
what hours are you showing up to work
right these are all things that you
could consider with a partner
um and i might do a follow-up video on
this with some more kind of
philosophical ideas about writing
business i kind of want to see what kind
of questions this generates this is a
good way to get started
to
think about partnership
in in a way that i think um
will get most people's uh
brains around it and and you know kind
of just cooking up um i have to go
unfortunately because i have a three
o'clock
um
but here yeah these are some
considerations for uh partnership that i
hope you find useful
and uh if you have follow-up questions
here um as like what it's like running
businesses with partnerships
or how to build good teams of partners
and things like that um let me know in
the comment section and we'll go over it
all right thanks everybody
