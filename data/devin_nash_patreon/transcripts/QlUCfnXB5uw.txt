hey so since these are so quick to make
i want to talk about failing forward i
got asked a question today by sonic
rider and the discord and he said uh hey
do you have any mentors for the patreon
like do you have anybody set up that can
contribute to the mastermind chat and i
was like no because i've just kind of
released this
as the absolute
most
alpha version of it as i can and and
looking at it you'll see like the
patreon as of the time of this recording
is like one
video and
way more patrons than i actually
expected to get
in the total history of it there's a
great video
i'm not gonna paraphrase by andrew kirby
and
it is called
start then learn don't learn then start
i love this video so i wanted to talk
about failing forward for a second here
and use the patreon as kind of an
example
because i think this is a really cool
thing so
uh there's kind of two ways we could
have done
the patreon
the option number one
was we could have
set up a whole group of masterminds get
like 10 people make like 20 videos
set up the tiers
specifically
have
five newsletters ready etc
number two was uh we do the absolute
bare minimum
and launch okay
and if you're here early enough you can
and you're reading this post in real
time you can tell which one we opted to
do because uh this is a super super
alpha product but the cool thing about
it is that probably in the next like six
months to a year it will not look
anything like it does today
so option number one i might have been
done
with the patreon like a year from now
and or two years from now and way too
many people when they're like starting
their business or they're starting
content creation or they're doing really
anything like lifestyle wise they're not
thinking about the fail forward concept
and they're instead just saying okay
well i will um get started once i feel
like i have a certain level of
competency that i can use to
get started and this is a
a procrastination method and i often
like to say that preparation is the
enemy of execution isn't that
interesting is that most people tell you
the opposite is like preparation makes
your execution better and that's true
but it's also the enemy of execution if
you do not prepare um or sorry if you
prepare too much you never execute and
most of the people that i find are stuck
in
the or are not executing or not
executing to the degree that they want
to are suffering from this particular
problem they're just not willing to
execute and suffer the potential failure
or the inevitable failure that will come
as a result of trying to fail forward
and instead they have this vision of
this like perfect product or service or
um stream or youtube video or whatever
that they want to create and it will
never happen um i often like to also
point to some of the uh stuff like on my
older channel uh actually i i won't even
actually yeah let's go let's go to
youtube.com alexia i think it takes you
to yeah it takes you takes you here
uh and you can see that like as much as
eight years ago i was producing super
dog videos in my backyard talking
about self-improvement i mean you can
look at the quality of this talking
about twitch and youtube even seven
years ago i've got some like weird ass
 cloud layer or something that's
like some top tech at the time uh my man
looks like he's about to join the
 special forces here looks like
he weighs like 50 pounds
skeletor up in here like what's going on
well um i got some rudimentary editing
you know i'm i'm i'm shooting my shot at
a channel update with 300 views seven
years ago most of those views are are um
retroactive they they came as a result
of later when i when i you know got
popular if
i'm popular and you'll see that like
i've been trying to do this for
years right and it's like horrible and
like this record of
i think some of this stuff is like some
of the that i'm the most grateful
for because like if i go to like
devon nash
and i sort by oldest
i mean it's just night and day
five years ago i started this channel at
like in clg house
and i had like a weird fisheye lens that
i bought from some guy that convinced me
that was a good idea
and i failed forward i got better and
these videos again mostly picked up
later at the time had like
around 400 to 500 views
they weren't interesting they weren't
the caliber that i create now
but um they're my history and they they
what i am today and my ability to make
videos like this exists because i was
able to do things like this so you may
be thinking that like you're not ready
to do something or you don't have the
preparation or you you lack the skill
set or whatever and what i'm telling you
is one of the most valuable things you
can do is just get started
and be prepared to accept the
inevitability of failure um the
possibility of failure the inevitability
of failure and just be okay with that
outcome
it's a trade-off for getting to success
realize that most people are not okay
with that outcome and that's why they
don't ever create anything so um this
applies to kind of every shot that you
don't take um is an opportunity cost
that you are um leaving on the table
because you you don't do these things
you don't you don't um decide to fail
forward first and execute you might not
have like the perfect plan to present to
your boss for a raise but you have kind
of the rough bullet points and you want
to go in on it don't wait the month or
whatever it takes to
uh get that done because you never know
what can transpire in that month and the
opportunities that you leave on the
table as a result of not doing that
so that's my talk thanks fail forward
bye
