okay so here's a topic i think that we
should talk way more about and i'm glad
that this came up we are answering a
mastermind question today
and that question reads
question for devin that's me i'm often
running free workshops to help pro game
masters with their business i do this
twice a month
they are highly recommended in the
community and they sometimes lead to
consulting calls i generally do this for
free but i get annoyed about some people
and they post a
thing made it to one of the is friday's
ad copy interactive meetings time ran
out before i could be assisted with mine
valuable information was put forth to
others that attended i will be able to
use
uh that seems okay all right my question
is how do i respond to the increasing
number of people feeling entitled for my
time
for free i don't have the energy for it
i'm already tapped out with what i give
for a while i was just linking them to
consulting rates but of course some
people complained a lot as well i'm
doing free workshop workshops but i am
worn out by these types okay
so i am going to explain a super
important concept um the short answer if
you don't want to watch the whole video
why would you be here
subscribing to stuff that is 40 minutes
long if you don't want to watch the
whole video but you're too nice um
you're way too nice and you can't be
that nice because i'm gonna explain
uh what i think everybody needs to know
about the difference between um
customers and and people that produce
things to do that we're going to uh you
know use this thing it's a notepad
so there are consumers and there are
producers okay um everybody in their
life regardless of
like what
some extent is a consumer
right you know you're consuming things
so
consumers are you know people that
consume things
so this is stuff like
playing video games
watching content
um
you know like tick tock social media
platforms
you can already see like this is bad
right and produces as things like
writing
creating
in the world crafting
making things
especially of value to people
right
producing
producing work producing work that
exists
in the world
sometimes for people to consume right
so you have consumers and producers
most people are consumers perpetually
and they only produce things so that
they can get a paycheck
or enough money to be able to consume
more things
once you switch your mindset from being
a
consumer to a producer and you start
trying to add things into the world
so whatever so most everyone is a
consumer right
they want to consume more information
more entertainment
more products
right more and more and more cars
everything
so a producer is valuable
because
there are less producers
than consumers
that makes sense right so
less people are making the thing
than
are consuming the thing luckily we have
things like automation and industry that
now allow us to produce one person can
produce at a great level so and that's
because of technology but there are far
less producers than there are consumers
that makes producers valuable so once
producers have a value
that value can be quantified and should
be quantified
in dollars
actual money
so
the problem is that like when you first
start producing stuff
not everybody is really sure that it's
valuable because
people are wary and they are already
consuming
things that
are amazing at getting their attention
so
you know if somebody has 24 hours in the
day to consume stuff and they spend like
an average of like six to eight hours
consuming that really is how long people
spend and and if you take nothing away
from this video the the thing you the
people that are listening this video
should take away is that if you want to
be successful in life stop consuming and
start producing and and make something
like right like even like and the point
is
at first when you start making stuff
it's gonna be
dog
right like like it's gonna be bad
everybody makes bad stuff my first
videos were terrible you can go to my
channel
everybody's first writing project or
article is going to be terrible the
first thing you make out of wood when
you're crafting something is going to be
awful right um there's all kinds of
different things that are going to be
terrible when you start producing but
the point is
producers are rare because people that
make quality stuff spend a lot of time
in
practice
to make that craft excellent and so when
you look at a person who's producing
high value stuff
that high value stuff is the product of
all the work they put in most people
don't want to put in that work so most
people don't produce at a high level
so
let's talk about the problem that our
friend is friday is having is friday
started off doing free workshops to help
pro game masters with their business so
why did is friday do this they did this
because
at first
is friday's stuff is not valuable
nothing that they are producing is
valuable because nobody yet trusts in
their expertise however what ends up
happening
as they start to produce more
is that people start to see them as an
expert on the subject
people start to see them as a person who
is providing value
and now all of a sudden you can go
to a youtube channel or to a article or
to however they run these workshops
and then you can see
hey
watching this for an hour actually made
me a better dm for my group that's
valuable that's that's that's that's
just something to value
so at first you have to do
free workshops
free newsletters
free videos right free everything
because you as a beginning producer
are trying to
convince
your audience that you are convinced a
potential audience do you even have an
audience yet right
that you are
a valuable person to listen to
but after you started producing things
and people are identifying things of
value
what is happening now is that people
will start tapping your expertise
for
time right there are different types of
people that do this but there is a
certain percentage of people that i call
time vampires
which i got from some old video
from the onion
some a long time ago
i love the phrase time vampire i think
that there are time vampires in all
kinds of different aspects of your life
what a time vampire is is it's someone
that is literally sucking your time out
of you
um either because of their excessive
asks or uh
just because that's the nature that
they're just people that
are going to ask for everything
and they don't have any expert they
don't understand the transaction like i
look at most
relationships in the business world as a
bank account
where like you can
withdraw
a certain amount from it as long as you
have a standing balance and you can add
to that balance with value so if you add
to that balance say you add fifty
dollars of theoretical value okay well i
can then theoretically extract up to
fifty dollars of that value so if
somebody
feels like i have added fifty dollars or
a hundred dollars to them i could
theoretically extract a hundred dollars
but the relationship would be
like they would have spent another
dollar at that point right so
my strategy is i want to put thousands
and thousands and thousands of dollars
into that bank account and then
i i might one day
ask for a withdrawal of like 10 bucks
right
but i most likely will do like or five
bucks a month like what the cost to
watch all these videos right is is five
bucks a month on patreon
in case this goes to youtube so this is
patreon.comnash
it costs five dollars a month it will
always cost five dollars a month for at
the time of this recording
70 videos that's a pretty good roi and i
assume i'm putting a lot into bank
accounts and then i might ask for five
bucks people are happy to do it because
like yeah i got a thousand bucks in this
bank account i'll get five bucks right
so
what's happening is
you have identified
that you're this person of value you've
started to put
money into this bank account and now
people are starting to realize it's
valuable well there's a lot of people
that want stuff for free a lot of people
play the watto hoping they're going to
get a bunch of free money a lot of
people try to get subscribed to get rich
quick streams and like we were just
talking about there is a certain
percentage of people that will just ask
ask ask with no understanding of that
value and that balance um of how that
transactional account works
um
you must get these people out of your
life as fast as possible particularly if
they're friends or family
and i i've been in a situation where
several of my close friends
have been involved with somebody that
just asks like this and it's never good
it can never go anywhere so first of all
there's going to be a percentage of
people that are not your customer and
will never be your customer and they're
going to be complaining they're going to
be your loudest percentage of people
they're going to be complaining they're
going to be like well all this should be
free it's just a game after all it's
dungeons and dragons like why should
people charge for this right they're
going to they're just going to be a pain
pain pay these people no mind they're
never going to be your customer they're
never going to give you a single dollar
they are just
they're just
they're losers they're losers and and
they're always going to be losers as
long as they have that mindset so
everybody that complains to you that is
of that caliber just discount them right
away and you'll save yourself a lot of
anxiety you do not owe them anything you
don't owe anybody anything this this
world doesn't owe anybody anything and
nobody in this world owes anybody
anything right um relationships are
built on
value on respect and on goodwill um
don't worry about all that okay so
if you're through that
now you've got the people that say
okay
um
i'm looking for your time
i might be willing to pay for it
but
i would rather
get this for free
or whatever
your answer is
your problem is
you're just too nice you you think that
you should be
adding
this free value to people
all the time
but in reality
as you
start to produce at a higher and higher
level okay let's talk for a moment about
what you will eventually be expert
producer okay an expert producer
still has 24 hours to produce
and now you have a problem
you have an audience
of maybe thousands of people
so giving your time to one person means
you are not giving that time
to the rest of that potential audience
so an expert producer must be very
careful with giving their individual
time
most of the people that are going to tap
an expert producer for their individual
time cannot use it anyway they won't be
effective with it even the vast majority
of people that managed to get an hour
with me don't utilize it they they i
give them i give them exactly the
information they need and for to go
forward
very few people ever come back to me and
go oh okay i actually implemented this
stuff and and it worked a few of them do
like and then i can i can i i know them
so well that i can actually
count how many there are like a good
example that is amaranth where i had
several
i mean like literally four hour meetings
with her and she implemented every
single thing i said and she was and was
unbelievably successful right so expert
producers
typically when you're giving somebody an
hour of your focused time
rarely will they ever utilize it
so you have so much more impact when you
are reaching out to larger numbers of
people
because
for free or for whatever because
some small percentage of people will get
will capture that value but it will be
higher because your your total your n
equals one
whereas
like there's one potential person that
can receive that whereas with a video or
an article or whatever you know
potentially thousands of people can
always research we can reach it and if
you're on the right platform then
potentially millions of people can be
on it so that's good
but also as an expert producer
your individual value
goes up and up for your time
as people are willing to pay more for it
so at the point that i am at
um i i can infinitely fill slots
for at least 500 an hour but i don't
because i like i don't do any of that
stuff i barely do any consulting like
that because
i want to
add value to projects that are affecting
a large number of people
so
the problem is that
beginning producers that are moving
towards being expert producers
the delta between those two things
and what is psychologically going on in
most of their minds
is that they is that is that they and
maybe you watching this video
do not understand
that their value is going up because to
them
if you're if you're a proper producer
then you're criticizing constantly all
of your work and you may not inherently
see the value in it because of that
even if other people define that value
even if they're paying you thousands of
thousands of dollars for that you can
look at any of the like
high-tier comedians
or
even the high-tier content creators who
really think their work is awful
but
they
they have they haven't internalized it
even though
you could look like someone like kevin
hart
who just thinks that
he's always trying to improve and yet
this guy is filling stadiums
making millions and millions of dollars
it doesn't matter right that that that
psychology of like i need to do better
never stops for a true
expert
they always think their work can be
better they always think their work
should be better so
you why i'm why i'm bringing that up is
because you will you will think
in a way
that
you think that your time is not worth
something but if people are willing to
pay for your time
uh and and and consume it you are
obligated to charge them for that right
and and for everybody that wants that
time for free
you're also obligated to tell them
my time is valuable
i have other ways i can use my time that
can produce and like just for
perspective i've had this conversation
probably hundreds of times in the last
10 years
like
i have had the exact conversation that
is look
i i understand you need something for me
or you think you do
my time is valuable
and if you are willing to pay x for it
which is whatever i've equated that time
value to like currently it's like 500 an
hour it should probably be more
um it's like three to five hundred
dollars an hour
if you're willing to pay that we can set
something up if i and only then if i
think that i can benefit you
um
because if i'm not going to take your
money if i don't think i can add value
otherwise um see you later and that's it
like that's the end of it it's literally
that simple
you don't owe them anything
because they haven't given you anything
there's no transaction there
they're asking for something for free
so
you
will get these people
um
that have a problem with that and i'm
looking at the the comments section
for the person that did this question
they say
i get a lot of passive-aggressive
comments from people when i don't take
time to specifically help them i also
get people that have a problem with me
linking their consulting when they do
ask me a question
so i suppose the problem is more of just
how do i do the deal with that in a
mindfulness way yeah you don't have to
do it in the mindfulness way you just
outright tell them
that that's not for free and that's how
not how the world works
like
i i think i've addressed some of these
problems before
and
i think that
i i i think i i think that like it's
hard to tell somebody that is too nice
like um
you don't
how do i even like that's the point of
this video though right is there's so
many people that need to hear this so i
i guess i should just like go out with
it like
maybe it's something else so particular
to like the dungeons and dragons
community that that
but this is everywhere
that like these people that are coming
in
that are being aggressive with you
because
they have a problem and they have a
problem with linking the quote first of
all i wonder like how real that is but
but like let's say it is real let's say
that like there really are these like
aggressive comments and stuff
you're the one that controls the flow of
information you're the one that controls
the value you're the one that's
producing
so a consumer has no power over you
there's an old phrase in business that
is the customer is always right
i hate that phrase
it's completely stupid and wrong the
customer is not always right in fact the
customer is rarely right the customer
doesn't understand anything
they don't understand how the sausage is
made they don't understand the practice
the work and the expertise that i put
into this right so i could give
the the second that i'm focusing
on what my customer wants
or thinks they want
is when i fail
i produce things
because i think that they are important
to the world
and um
because
i see an enormous amount of value in
something that needs to be said
and i really want it to help people and
i'm authentically coming from that place
in my heart that i want to help people
like really i am like i just i really
want people to win
so i'm going to i'm going to like
internalize that into a subject matter
and then i'm going to do it the best i
 can with no expectation or i
don't owe them like they don't owe me
anything they don't have to pay me they
don't have to give me money they don't
have to do anything i just want to put
that out there and no one has to listen
i'm going to make these videos even if
nobody talks about it no like nobody
ever listens to him
that's my that's my dharma right
so for someone to come in and and to
insert themselves into that and say you
should produce this way you should do
this you should not link me consult dude
 you i you have no power over me at
all right i'm going to produce these no
matter what
and and that's the attitude you should
take there's no mindfulness here there's
no like forgiveness there's no sam
hairness harris awakening you just
need to outright get those people out of
your life and do your
like like stop being a
stop being you're being a wuss about
this right like you're just you're like
you're letting these people keep you
down
who have absolutely no skin in the game
they're putting in a one percent effort
to send you a message
that that is that is angry
and and you are taking time away from
what you ought to be doing which is
producing good work good quality work
to to listen to these people you're
doing a disservice to everybody that is
actually getting value from your
because you are wasting your time with
this nonsense stop doing it you don't
owe them anything
you are a producer
which is what i hope to encourage every
single person to be
in some way in this world to add values
to produce
one of the large reasons why i'm here is
to teach people how to produce better
and how to get it to more people because
i think ultimately and this is kind of
the crux of it
production is is a really beautiful
thing i think everybody has this really
unique voice and everybody can add
something to the world in such an
incredible unique way whether it be
through their voice through the written
word through the videos they make
through the business they start through
the value they add to other people
through volunteering like everybody has
this unique energy they're kind of
brought into this world with
that is a it's a disservice to humanity
if they don't produce and and put that
out there and i think all of us as human
beings have this desire to do that and
to like really
um create something in the world do more
than just like you know sit around and
like watch tick tock all day i don't
think that's anybody's dharma i i think
that's just the dharma of people that
haven't found their way or have lost
their way
so
um
as a as a person
that is moving from
[Music]
that life of consumption
to being a beginning producer
it insults me
that you are
wasting your time
with these vampires
and you should stop doing it
because just like in dungeons and
dragons they drain your level every time
they hit you
and if your level goes low enough you
die
i want every beginning producer
to move towards being an expert producer
so that i can consume the awesome
they make
so don't waste your time with these
people it's not valuable
focus entirely
on bringing the best thing you can bring
into the world
and people will pay for your time
and if they don't
that's not your problem you cast them
aside
because your dharma and everyone's
dharma listening to this
is to produce things of value in this
world hopefully to make it a little bit
of a better place
okay that's it
