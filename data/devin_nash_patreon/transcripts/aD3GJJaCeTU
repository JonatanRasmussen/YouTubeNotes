today we are talking about one of my
favorite subjects of all time when it
comes to marketing advertising which is
saying something and that is outrage
marketing controversial marketing
controversial content marketing
this
subject has applications mainly for
content creators but
is relevant to anybody that is trying to
start a business or advertise in any way
as you will see as you watch this video
so before we begin
two things number one is i think that
ethically and morally speaking i'm not
trying to put a lens on anything um i
think our world is run by outrage
marketing and controversy marketing
today and there's a lot of problems with
that i'm not here to discuss those
problems right i'm here to give you
tactical tools to be able to utilize in
your
own success and you debate the ethics
and morality of that i don't care i'm
just giving you the tools okay i i don't
think a gun is dangerous except in the
hands of somebody that intends to use it
so
take that with you as you go forward the
second thing is if we are going to
talk about outrage marketing we need to
define it
and i think i've come up with a
definition that i'm happy with and
that's that driving controversy through
some kind of opinion or content piece
and controversy is conversation or
opposed conversation two people talking
about
something that they disagree on
so
if you understand that you kind of
understand the basis of it and
controversy and outrage marketing is
dominating our world today i think it
was really powerful
but it especially
took
hold during the donald trump era in the
united states where
that form of just hard take marketing
was so powerful
enough to win a presidency right i think
no matter what side you are on with that
whole thing you you would have to just
just look if you can and this is why
this topic is see even talking about the
topic of controversy controversial
marketing is controversial
it's so great um if you can step away
from whatever your opinion is on that as
hard as that is to do which is really
why outrage marketing already works
right but we're not even into it yet
you're starting to see some of the
principles of it
step away totally from that whether you
think it was good or bad and just look
at the methodology of the marketing of
how
that kind of content was delivered to
the usa it was so precise and powerful
it's amazing it's it's so incredible how
that works and and that's the basis of
of outrage market is to get people to
take a stance on something and it's it's
to do it with the um sometimes with the
intent to be inflammatory and sometimes
with the um with the intent to
um
uh spark some kind of like controversy
so so there are people in our world
there are leaders in our world
not just donald trump who i think is one
of the greatest marketers of all time
just just objectively right regardless
of what you think of him there are
leaders in our world who are amazing at
doing this so i'm going to give you an
example of something that just happened
yesterday which was this tweet so
netflix shares creator 20 after company
reports has lost subscribers for the
first time more than 10 years elon musk
responds on twitter the woke mind virus
is making netflix unwatchable
this is such a great tweet from a pure
marketing perspective again no matter
what you think about the subject i just
keep in mind through this entire video
i'm not putting any positions
politically or any kind of commentary on
the subject itself i just don't care
about that i i always stay away from
that stuff i don't care i love marketing
for what it is which is its ability to
gain attention and in that respect this
is so powerful this is such a good tweet
because oh my god it takes a very firm
position saying that
netflix is basically trash because these
shows are moving too much in this like
woke direction
and it is such a firm statement that you
either agree or disagree with and that
is what drives engagement and just tons
of people talking about it the people
retweeting it right so outrage marketing
content marketing are enormously
powerful they are the most imp powerful
tools in marketing but you don't have to
be inflammatory and there is a way to do
outrage marketing without being
inflammatory
um or at least with without targeting
things that can hurt you so i'm gonna
give you some
um
advice on that
i'm just taking a note real quick
once i get into the principles
and i want you to take a look at
the um videos that are my most popular
videos of all time which i have sorted
for you here
so you'll see every single one of these
is absolutely a controversial issue but
it's not attacking anybody in particular
so for why you should never become a
twitch affiliate
one of the techniques that i i love to
do is i love to attack corporations and
i love to attack platforms and i like
doing that because i don't have to
single out an individual but individual
outrage marketing works incredibly well
look at someone like keemstar for
example um or any anybody that really
like does that kind of drama stuff
attacking individuals can can work fine
i just ethically don't like doing that
so i rather would attach a corp attack a
corporation
and the benefit of that is like
at the very worst
only the employees of that corporation
hate you but i find if you're
constructive in that criticism that
actually they respect you more and so i
end up working with tons of people at
twitch despite the fact that i'm grossly
negative on the platform i think anybody
would say that i'm probably a harshest
critic i i think that's a pretty safe
assumption right i mean outside of its
major streamers who would give some
commentary but at least
as far as industry professionals so
um
many many many of my videos focus on
that and all of them are controversial
right even topics that are not outrage
marketing controversial are worded in a
way that are very direct and either you
disagree or agree with exactly how to
grow a stream from zero to 100 viewers
so either that is
exactly how to do that or it's not right
it's either or but you can disagree with
it or you can agree with it but i'm not
saying how to grow a twitch stream i
didn't word it that way deliberately
because i want you to like this is
exactly how to do it right um but if you
look at outside of that video
basically everything everything else is
controversial in subway so here's a good
example of a title that is not
inflammatory but is is absolutely a
controversy or conversation starting
topic the fastest growing twitch
streamer right so if i say that ludwig
is the fastest growing twitch streamer
at the time of the videos filming he was
objectively uh in terms of in terms of
numbers but that means that there is no
other fastest growing twitch streamer so
if if if hussein bolt says he's the
fastest man on earth which is something
he's said several times there can't be
another faster man and that's a very
powerful statement to make it's much
faster it's much better than saying i
won the gold medal x amount of times
well sure anybody can do that being the
fastest man of earth that's that's a
different thing so you know who else
said they're the fastest person on earth
and got a ton of press for that logan
paul right where he did a he he actually
used that to market a
marathon or like a race or something for
youtubers to raise money for charity
they said i'm the fastest person alive
come out and beat me i'll give you a
hundred thousand dollars that's a hell
of a statement to make that's a
conversation starter right um you look
at all my top videos and you'll see
that
um
every one of these things in some of
them to like a great degree right the
end of top twitch streamers that that's
that's a that implies that there is
there is no future that is the end of
them right
like streamers do this or fail in 2020.
that video is still getting tons of
views do this or fail right um new dmca
tech bands top streamers in three
seconds
these are very
firm statements that you can agree or
disagree with and look many people will
disagree and we're going to get into the
fundamentals okay but this is what you
want to try to do you want to try to
start conversations you want people to
go to war over these opinions for or
against you you want to tear people
apart they're only as good as the world
allows them to be
i'll show you when the chips are down
these uh these civilized people
they'll eat each other
see
all right you want people to talk about
these issues like crazy and you have to
stand fearless
in the face of that as they disagree
with you we're gonna get to that in a
minute all right so
back to the notes after you see this
youtube most people are never going to
grow as content creators
right and a huge reason why they're not
going to grow is because they're afraid
of being controversial it is easy to
take the middle path
and it is lukewarm to do so
and they don't and we as human beings
despite all the negativity you see in
the world and everything we as human
beings the vast majority of human beings
do not like conflict i don't like
conflict particularly right i don't want
to like really fight people and like
like get in with people and things like
that i'd rather live a peaceful life
like most people like most people almost
everybody
and i think except for the people that
train themselves out of this do not like
conflict they they naturally like to
kind of go with the flow and they don't
want to really upset everybody and
that's great most human beings are
naturally good but
the the thing about understanding
understanding controversy right
is that controversy itself can never
kill you or harm you
unless two things happen
or one of two things happen
okay number one
is you're crazy enough
to get the platform
and number two is you do it to yourself
so i have a video that's called i think
it's called the problem with cancel
culture i i don't know something it's
the one that called me carson on the on
the front of it
and what i say is that
in that video i'll just summarize it for
you so you don't have to go watch it but
like in that video i bring up a lot of
examples of various content creators
some that have survived cancellation
completely
and some that are just com basically a
shadow of their former self are just
completely platform the difference
always is
the amount that they lean in
to the controversy because their
narcissism their ego which is part of
what drives every content creator to
create content
is ego and narcissism
it can't avoid
them diving into that and and attacking
it's one of the hardest things to do
when you are truly in a situation where
you might be canceled is to just step
back and wait but
if you look at the way that hollywood or
serious industry professionals in
entertainment handle
things like controversy
they
do like third-party pr statements step
back for a year donate to charity come
back if there's nothing happened look at
louis c.k right one of the biggest
controversies ever right just won a
grammy right because
what he did quite literally was he
by the way he would have grammy for a a
comedy album that addresses
like
the jokes about what what he did okay um
what did he actually do for the last two
years he peaced out
went and did shows in like europe and
russia and like different places where
um
he uh did shows and and did content and
he stepped back from the white
completely and i guarantee you over the
next year right he'll he'll come back
into it
he doesn't
he didn't
lean into this or or make a ton of
public statements or make a potential
media where because that will only just
get that crowd to eat you and eventually
you'll get they'll they'll de-platform
you a good example of this in recent
times on twitch is destiny where uh
destiny
took the fight right he he couldn't help
but take that fight and and so what
eventually got him was he was on a panel
against these people
who would never have been convinced of
his opinion they they would they would
never
this is this this happened to be on um
trans issues right and these people
would never have been moved on his
opinion they just would not do that and
they they got him they
eventually um
the the mass reports and everything got
him to be banned permanently and
definitely off of twitch right but if he
had stepped back from that and and made
no statements and just continuing on his
way would have been fine so eventually
you can either be crazy enough to get d
platformed
with with with really really
controversial takes and i'm gonna
explain how to mitigate yourself
um from that in the actual like key
section here
because if this video if this video
doesn't seem tactical yet it will get
tactical don't worry like um
i'm gonna tell you what how to avoid
getting the platform but the second
thing is you have to you do it yourself
and this is actually far more common so
when
you do something wrong and the and we're
we're hardwired as human beings to
uh for the when the tribe disapproves of
us
and and threatens us with exile the
scariest thing for a human being you
might you might have heard public
speaking is really scary for human
beings right why is that actually do we
suspect one of the big reasons we
suspect that public speaking is really
scary is because in the neolithic era
and onward
the way that cultures were set up was if
you had a tribe of people who
disapproved you for something
you would have to get up and explain
yourself to these 100 to 150 people on
average that was comprise the tribe at
that time
and if you didn't explain yourself the
right way you would get exiled and if
you exiled in that time you're dead so
this is a life or death situation to
speak and it's suspected by by many
anthropologists and many uh social
scientists that the reason why we're
scared of public speaking is because
of that reality so in the exact same way
we also don't want to disappoint the
tribe we don't want to disappoint people
who
we we we we're looking for approval from
people especially people that we view as
part of our community so like in this
example like if you're a gamer you would
want approval from other gamers and so
if you have unleashed a controversial
opinion
you and now you're surprised by dozens
of tweets or
top page threads or things like that
you
might get really surprised that
that they're attacking you and now you
might want to either defend yourself
which again like it's the wrong thing to
do right or you might want to cancel
yourself because you feel in your heart
that you've done something wrong whether
you have or you haven't they'll do
everything they can to make you feel
like you have
and then they'll um
they'll eat you and you'll and you'll
lose you'll you'll you'll
you'll
you'll beat yourself out of a job i'm
not sure if that's the right way to say
you'll kill yourself out of a job right
um
or or sometimes you'll literally do that
because uh like the depression gets you
or whatever but the reality is
that um
no one cares
at all about these things really
their passerby comments
um nobody like holds on to it in that
way and i'm gonna give you an example of
a story
so
at the time in esports when i was
running clg
i would frequently get
front page reddit threads of things that
i did that people disagreed with because
you as a team owner can make really
controversial opinions
or start really controversial decisions
that people have opinions over
so
one of those opinions was on a podcast
one time and i said i don't believe in
talent i don't think it exists and i
still don't think that exists i don't
think that talent exists in the sense
that
there is no such thing as like natural
gene born talent i think that everything
is hard work so
there's caveats to that like there are
physical
things that can improve a person like if
you are 6'5 you're gonna be better at
basketball but in the in the mental
world of like things like chess or any
kind of other skill or things like that
there's there's that doesn't require any
kind of physical dexterity or agility or
strength there is no such thing as
talent but that's really controversial
opinions that people say okay this guy
is selecting players
um
should he be a person that like is doing
that because he because he believes this
so the reason why i
said that was because i i'm pretty sure
that absolutely nobody listening to this
talk
i was aware of that story or whether
that happened
and maybe maybe like the
the people that have been following me
for like years but even if you've been
doing that you don't care about that
story right now that's a really big
thing front page right thread thousands
of up boats bunch of comments right
nobody cares right so no matter how
controversial it gets
that people will eventually forget and
as long as you understand that the media
cycle is focused on like these sort of
temporary outrages you can manipulate
that to great effect and um i've learned
that over the years by just being in
front of these things it's one of those
things that where you have to create
this controversy and then weather the
storm to see it
but after dozens and dozens if not
hundreds of threads on reddit after
hundreds and hundreds of thousands of
posts after many many messages to die in
a fire or whatever have you you realize
that these are just like puffs in the
wind and that they're not even
reflections of you personally they're
just people that are like in a certain
state that are like expressing
themselves
projecting themselves quite literally
on their own suffering and misery and
you can do a funny test where like
you can go and look at the profile of
someone that's like physically
threatened you or something and always
their their profile is inflammatory 100
it's not like a well-adjusted like put
together person who just suddenly got
mad at you it's like a person who is
struggling with like mental issues every
single time like two of fault i've never
had that not happen right i used to do
this to make myself feel better about
negative commentary i don't want to get
this video too off track because this is
a video about outrage marketing but
that's just like you know you do it to
yourself is kind of the point here okay
so let's talk about we'll start to like
get into some
more tactical stuff about like how to
actually do this
and how to utilize this so
utilizing
outrage marketing
your objective is to get
people talking about an issue
and to take sides
so it's not to intentionally piss people
off necessarily right that is one way to
do it but
you really want to have a conversation
start and i'll use an example
of um
one of the twitter threads that i just
made
as of the time of this recording right
which is which is decent engagement and
that's the current model of
livestreaming is unsustainable the
future of live content is events this is
a
topic about the problem with live
streaming content right now and how a
few creators are ahead of the curve so i
um
made this thread
mainly with the objective of starting a
conversation around this issue that the
and i did that by presenting the problem
so one of the ways that you can utilize
outrage marketing is to present
a solid
solid stance on a problem
so the solid stance that i took on this
problem was i think events are the
future of twitch because i think
long-form marketing is unsustainable
sorry when i say long for market i mean
these long streaming hours is uh is i
needlessly complicated that phrase
um
long streaming hours are unsustainable
and
short form has to take over because
otherwise people will go insane and many
people disagree with this right notably
the person that i actually highlighted
in the thread cutie cinderella herself
disagreed that her event was beneficial
and then went on to talk about that for
an hour on stream about how she
disagreed with me and thought i was full
[ __ ] now that's great for me right
that's fantastic because that's an
audience of two or three however many
concurrent viewers she had at that time
that are hearing about me who otherwise
wouldn't have heard about me so see how
i responded to that the the vast
majority of people would have said oh my
god i'm so stressed out this person said
all this stuff about me um was like
negative and disagreed with me all this
stuff right but the way i i looked at it
was like man that's that's three
thousand four thousand people more than
that actually because that's just
concurrent viewers so actually like in
terms of live views probably 15 or 20
000 people that got that that came onto
this topic and would not have otherwise
done that had i not had a key member of
the person so i'm so glad that she
disagreed with me i think she's wrong
right and i have a lot of data to
support that but it doesn't matter the
fact is that uh that that happened okay
so you want to take a solid stance on a
problem and it should be a stance that
people can ideally disagree with if they
if they choose to right way too many
people are going to walk back their
opinions they're going to walk back the
way they talk about things because they
are
um just want to be too lukewarm
now again this can get you in trouble it
gets me in trouble all the time but it's
fine the trouble doesn't matter it even
gets me in trouble in my real life right
like a lot of the time i i'll tell you a
story one time i was i was with a friend
in a car
and
he's like can i turn here and i was like
yeah just do it and i was so confident
that he turned and he went into a
one-way and almost died
right and i do that all the time like
but my girlfriend she tells me all the
time she's like so
it's so annoying to talk to you because
you will say something like yeah it's
like this and you don't even know
right like you're not you're like 100
positive shirt but i i i i'm so
confident in the way that i speak that
it sounds like
that's an absolute so um
your objective is to like is to come out
of an issue with a really solid take now
i try as hard as i can to be data-backed
and and to have the right information
but i get things wrong i don't always
have the information that i think i have
right i can't always be right that's the
thing okay so
um your objectives to get people talking
about the issue and it takes sides and
and is to present a solid stance on the
problem
and then you want to choose a medium
that makes sense for this and allows you
to have this discussion so twitter is
actually a phenomenal medium for people
to disagree on
news flash if you were to wear i think
twitter's probably the best place to
start an outraged marketing campaign but
youtube's great too any any kind of like
evergreen content that exists um in this
sense because this form of bargaining is
so
incredibly powerful even twitch is a
phenomenal place to do it and many many
many broadcasters have made their
full-time career off of drama right and
and even if you go look like right now
at uh at the
titles that a lot of the top creators
use and keep in mind i'm not even i
don't even know what i'm going to see
here but i guarantee i'll be right okay
so just some of the top creators let's
look at asmongold's title
as when gold's title is huge day dragon
flight news and drama
lost dark news and drama right xqc
click here or or
right
like like click here or it'll come for
you whatever right right
drama so
if you look at what the top content
creators are doing they are utilizing
this idea right that there is always
like some kind of like outrage there's
always something to talk about even if
there's not right like it's literally
just the wow announcement for asthma
gold okay so every platform works for
this but i think that
platforms where people are used to
arguing
um but people are great like twitter but
people argue everywhere people are you
on youtube and just arguing comments for
for shouting to the void to spend hours
on this [ __ ] right um those reddit
campaigns are successful doing this kind
of stuff controversial stuff works
everywhere
and again
the the most important thing is that it
creates that impression on a user that
you exist right the only way to kill
something is for it is to ignore it
otherwise it lives forever literally
rent free in everybody's head okay um
there are
like so you could select things or you
could do things that surprise people and
surprise is a form of controversial
marketing that people might disagree
with right um things that are memorable
so um one of the best examples of this
uh that i love to use is the is the
cocad or was it pepsi oh god um
the
ad with kylie
where
i i'm sure where she
i have this in my notes and then my nose
disappeared
here we go
i think it's a pepsi ad
it was pepsi ad 2017
they uh
kendall jenner did this ad you might
remember it
it's like still on vimeo
and if you remember this this was this
ad where there was like this
riot and all these like kind of woke
people are going so like she solves like
world peace because she gives a pepsi
over um this at the time
was like one of the best i i looked at
this and even as like an amateur
marketer at the time i was like this is
like literally
one of the absolute best
marketing
uh uh the marketing campaigns of all
time
and it was so controversial it drove so
many people to think about pepsi when
they hadn't before
and maybe initially there's some huge
boycott
but if you look at like any of the like
ea or blizzard stuff
all the people that say they're going to
boycott after diablo 2 resurrected all
the people that say they're going to
boycott after warcraft all the people
that say they're going to book up blah
blah blah right doesn't matter doesn't
affect sales whatsoever everyone's still
buying the same shitty call of duty game
every november doesn't matter right
we've seen that again and again again so
the key is to make impressions all right
so how do you actually do this like we
saw we've talked about the objective is
to get people talking about an issue and
take sides but how do you actually think
about something to like um to like talk
about okay so the first thing is
research the most controversial
topics around your industry or issue
oh a quick note for people that are um
not content creators you might be
thinking uh so far
i i don't see how to apply this
the way that you apply this is through
ads so you might all remember things
like this
right
like amazingly famous old spice at old
spice had an incredible marketing
campaign forever right again the the
pepsi type stuff you you can um
you can advertise your products in such
a way
that utilizes these concepts so things
like um
absolutely
the number one product in this field you
can use terminology like that right so
you hopefully kind of see how this
applies across the products and such
things
so research the most controversial
topics in your area
and then
think about
how a topic
can be put into either or terms okay so
if you have a topic that you're going to
talk about
think about how it could
you you kind of like put it on one side
and a side that people could disagree
with
take a firm position on something
this is what i believe and this
is what
i don't believe
and
here's some easy ideas just to kind of
get you started on this right
so for example you could attack a
platform
service
or large entity which is not going to
turn its head to you and care you could
also react to larger people
or do takes on their opinions
so this is a really great technique to
use if you're a content creator because
you can
do something like so so many people are
talking on their streams about something
that i did
a bunch of times on twitter
i've been referenced in the philip
defranco show because i will provide
a pretty serious take on some kind of
event so reacting and responding to
news events with a serious firm take
i've used this to great success and
showed up on a bunch of media because of
it gotten interviews and all kinds of
things from it
so like here's my position on this this
is this is absolutely what i think
and um
you may think i've actually heard a
couple of criticisms here where some
people say well okay
that's great that you showed up on
philip defranco but that's just because
you have a platform but you have to
understand that i have a platform
because i did these things right because
everybody starts with zero followers and
so you're gonna gain a platform that's
so much faster
if you are using controversial marketing
even and i would say that most people
would agree that i didn't do this in
like i never did this in like an
inflammatory way i had some moments like
i went after phase clan pretty hard and
i don't regret that i think they deserve
it to this day
and i i just think that generally that
company is like amazing that is still
above water and that it doesn't
go down for just like a plethora of
ethical violations and crazy [ __ ] that
they do
so i've had my fair share of that but a
lot of that kind of stuff early on got
me on the map by being controversial but
still
i was able to
you know kind of like stay on on the
side of like not being inflammatory
especially towards specific people so i
always always stay respectful of
specific individuals which i recommend
you do i i don't think you should take
away from this video that you should go
on attack campaigns for individuals um
and here's why individuals are are works
in progress so
we tend to think of an individual as a
as like or you might think of me like
devin nash is like the total body of
like what you know of my work but in
reality i'm like this evolving person
right that gets things like wrong and
right so the statement that i make today
on something might be something that i
think even tomorrow is different and
this is the case with everybody so when
you attack an individual like you feel
like you're talk you're attacking a
solid object but you're really attacking
an element and i don't think that's fair
whereas if you're attacking like a
platform or a service or a or or a news
something that happened in the world or
something like that it's a lot better to
do because you have the facts of the
matter and you can kind of address them
and then discuss that so for example
twitch's enforcement policy on bands
right is something that is i would say
is a way better topic to talk about than
the reason soda popham was banned and if
that was bad or not but both will work
right if you take a controversial
standpoint but it's easier to take on
the twitch band problem because it is a
problem that we can pull a lot of
factual evidence about and i actually
intend to take on that problem soon um
because i i think that one of the
biggest problems for large creators
right now is they're just getting banned
randomly and this is like they're
literally their bread and butter this is
their platform it's [ __ ] crazy that a
platform owns that kind of um
that has that kind of power over people
so
i would rather attack that service than
that problem
um
or react to a blog post or a youtube
update or a update from trust and safety
from them
right um then i would actually to attack
individuals
and i would rather i i'd rather attack
things that that have a hard time
attacking back not not out of cowardice
but out of respect for individuals
um okay so
the other thing i would say is um
well actually i think we can just move
into like keys of this so my keys of
what to know okay so first key and most
important key is authenticity taking on
a stance
you have to believe and you have to
defend what you're saying
you should have data to back up what
you're saying and you should have
information that backs up what you're
saying
one of the biggest problems that we have
in our society today
and is that we have a lot of people that
are saying things that have absolutely
no basis of truth so i feel like truth
has kind of gone off the window you
might feel the same especially on social
platforms where
people are just saying things about
different controversial topics and
there's absolutely no evidence these
things even happened so with
authenticity you should take an honest
stance that you actually truly believe
in but you should also be introspective
enough to go back and say okay is this
true and and then
ultimately when you're confronted with
information that proves you wrong you
should take ownership of that which is
one of the hardest things to do but as
long as you are authentic in your belief
of something that conviction will convey
to your audience and your audience will
respond so
even if you are wrong if you're
authentic you
will be
powerful right so famously
joe rogan
was doing an interview and someone said
why did you come back to fear factor joe
rogan says it's 100 for the money
and then everybody just laughs right
that's kind of a crazy thing to say
like you know the the sort of textbook
media answer would be well you know i'm
really excited to do the show
um
right like i i the same thing with the
spotify deal but he's like i just took
it for the money it's fu money i'm done
people respect that kind of authenticity
right you inherently respect that kind
of honesty so taking an honest stance is
always good do not lie and especially
don't ever lie in the face of like if
you're creating content or you're
building a product or your ability to
service
this is something i'm really firm on and
something i have guarded so hard in in
like my entire business
do not ever lie do not ever even tell a
white lie tell things as true as you
know it to be with as much data as you
can and then as soon as you have any
information that disproves that you
should take ownership of it
and
that is so important because
as peop as people
start to follow your legacy
your authenticity and your conviction
will be your main currency it'll be your
currency above everything else and if
people know you to be an authentic and
honest person they'll stand with you
even
if they think you're wrong on something
because they know that if you realize
that you'll come back and you'll work on
it and you'll you'll you'll be better
and you'll improve but if you
are if you lie for benefit
you will
um
uh you will uh that'll eventually catch
up with you and i'm gonna give you i'll
tell you a story so
um one of the most important things
about building this creative agency was
the percentages that we take from
creators and i said we're going to take
20 of deals no matter what
and um that's how it's going to work and
then i entered into several instances in
the agency world where i didn't have to
do that um basically
when you i could kind of get into how
this works but like just for the sake of
it there are ways to like write
contracts in a way that nobody would
care
and because of the way the agencies
control budget i could have quite
literally taken hundreds of thousands of
dollars on top of very high percentages
and i would never ever ever have been
called out on it nobody would ever know
not anybody in this community not
anybody in my extended community nobody
would know and um nobody would care like
like it's not it's not it's just like
literally expected in the agency world
i'm not saying i'm doing anything
illegal i'm saying like yeah i would
like you could like literally just
charge agency fees right and i could
rack this stuff up it's all in the
contracts all written down
the way that money changes hands and the
expectations in the entertainment
industry just means the agencies take a
lot of money and i didn't do it i just
didn't do it because
that authenticity and that conviction
comes through in everything you say and
everything you do it comes through in
every way that you act it comes through
and there's something there's something
some lizard thing some subjective thing
some ancient thing
where we are able to detect that
[ __ ] in somebody and as soon as you
compromise yourself on that i promise
you're done you may not be done
immediately but eventually you're done
as a serious practitioner you're done if
you if you compromise your authenticity
so i'm spending so much time on the
authenticity standpoint because i want
it to be very clear that if you're going
to embark on outrage marketing which is
super powerful but also really dangerous
not only for you but your audience you
need to stay authentic you need to stay
honest or you lose everything without
authenticity you might be popular and
you might be famous but you will be a
shadow of your former self you will
never be happy if you look at the people
that use drama like people like keemstar
that use drama and farm like that's not
a happy person and those people are
happy because they there is a sort of
deep-seated thing where they know that
they are not authentic do not be those
people you need to rise above that okay
so that's the key of what to know
authenticity number one number two a
straightforward
position so again i use the example in
the beginning of this video i don't
believe in natural talent
very easy to understand you might
disagree but that's my state that's my
stance right so very straightforward
position right i i don't believe in
natural talent so as easy as you can
define your axiom there right okay
next is fearlessness
you're going to get negative feedback
if you are listen to me if there's
anything you take away from this video
okay if you are doing something in this
world that is worthy of attention
you will get negative feedback
that's it so prepare for it whether
you're doing controversial [ __ ] or not
if you do not get negative feedback if
you don't get pushed back on your ideas
you're [ __ ] boring nobody cares about
what you're doing so what my nft videos
that i did
have like a 40 like rate people hate the
idea that i stand behind web 3. even
though i'm not even showing any web 3
i've never told anybody what projects
i'm working on right of course i
wouldn't because that's super unethical
so i i haven't told anybody a single
thing about the products that i'm i i
personally am invested in right even
though i have an audience then they i
could increase the value that blah blah
blah simultaneously we've turned down
probably i don't know how many millions
of dollars in nft deals and coin shills
that have come through and been on our
desk
right like and again things that in the
agency world i i could easily have done
nobody would know
there's like our names not attached to
it at all we do the whole activation
activate it for influence or peace out
whatever i don't do it right so people
are attacking me for my position on nfts
in web3 to this day i still get messages
all the time people that are like blah
blah blah
i hate this right people attacking my
position on web3 super easy to do right
now because nfts are
in [ __ ] not surprising because 99 were
worthless
people attacked me on it but i stand in
the face of it i say i still support
web3 still believe in it absolutely 100
but i stay to my authenticity i do not
i'm not gonna show an nft i'm not gonna
tell you to go buy some coin i'm also
not gonna run deals on the back end to
do that because that's my authenticity
that's what i said this is what i'm
gonna [ __ ] do right there's a great
quote in kingdom of the heaven speak the
truth even if it means your death be
fearless in the face of negative
feedback if you are not doing something
that gets negative feedback if every
comment on your video is positive you
[ __ ] up you should take that as an l
that's that's not good
so you need to be fearless in the face
of this and then fourth
will this start a conversation this is
so important right you should ask
yourself this before you produce
anything you should ask yourself this
before you design an ad for your product
or service will this start a
conversation
right so it comes down to even the
sentence structure and the web copy that
you use
the actual way that you talk about
things should it start a conversation
this should start a conversation this
video if i if i did a thread about this
on twitter the way that i would like i
would like orient this
is i would say something like outrage
marketing is the most powerful form of
marketing
here's how to use it to your advantage
that might be how i start that right
oh man is that controversial right
because implicit in that even if i say
later
that
it is that is not my intent
implicit in that is that
the power of outrage marketing ought to
be used and there's a conversation to be
made right there i could even get way
more
inflammatory than that right like um
you could start it off with the majority
of influencers
using outrage i wouldn't use outrage
marketing to use something more
inflammatory than that so like the
majority of influencers
are growing because of drama
here's how
and then a threat about that see that's
that's a conversation starter
and we go on about that right so just
thinking about this right because i'm
asking myself this question is that will
this start a conversation i'll
absolutely start a conversation now i
could say something like um
a different way to work that so like
let's look at these two statements right
influencers
or top influencers
are growing from farming drama
a thread about
the reality
of the
of the influencer meta
i like yeah that's like a really
powerful one and obviously i like mess
with it i'm just like ad hocking right
now okay versus something like this
right um
how to use content marketing to your
advantage
um
in five easy steps
first one is like
this seriously starts a conversation the
second one is like cool okay like you
see this all the time
maybe you know somebody picks it up but
this one is saying the exact same thing
right it's like the exact same topic
and you can even say how to use outrage
marketing
and this just isn't sexy it's like it's
not like it doesn't like jump out at you
but top influences are growing from
farming drama a threat about the reality
of influence or meta and then you talk
about these issues right you see the
difference hopefully by putting this
example out there in that way i show you
what i mean by like how powerful
rewording something is
and again
um this takes all of these tips
and it puts them into one sentence so
i'm authentic i think top influences are
growing from from drama
i have a very straightforward position
right
that this is what they're doing they
either are or they're not and there's
gonna be tons of people that come in
like no they're growing from this and
this or know that this streamer has or
this youtuber is doing it through like
would you mister beast does
great right i love it
yes give me more impressions fearless we
get that negative feedback well let's
start a conversation absolutely right so
that is how to think about outreach
marketing
overall
just remember that like
whether you choose to utilize this or
not
understand it is really important
because it it
you learn how to word craft and and so
much of how we communicate is the words
that we use and the impression that we
leave upon another person the
communication that that person receives
as a result of what we say so regardless
of what we say as long as i convey that
certain emotion that's what i'm going
for that's the principles of outrage
marketing it's a kind of a primer on
outreach marketing so let me know what
you think and thanks for watching i hope
you got something out of this because
that's what these are for bye
