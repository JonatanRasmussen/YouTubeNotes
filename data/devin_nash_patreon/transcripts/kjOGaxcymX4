so i saw a great question come up in the
patreon mastermind chat in our discord
and i wanted to address it here this is
one of the ones that i don't think
everybody is going to agree with this
but i think it's really important um so
this is about criticism and about talk
receiving criticism which i i originally
was going to structure this video for
content creators and i realized like oh
but this is actually a topic that like
involves everybody that runs a business
or has any kind of like criticism for
because if you go out there and you do
something like outside of your house
then people are going to criticize you
and that's especially true of anybody
that's trying to do anything in the
public
but it's going to be true everywhere so
this all started because there was a
message that said um
hey okay so here's one how do you deal
with criticism over your artistic
choices i basically run dnd and there's
a lot of opportunity for home brew and
changing of the rules however i decided
my sessions directly influenced my
players enjoyment um i've come into some
conflicts with my groups because they
seem to take issue and hold reservation
with every choice i make as a dungeon
master that isn't standard and i become
very frustrated over it uh dming is a
craft and artistic expression i'd like
to be able to improvise as i feel fit or
else is not just enjoyable to me um but
if the players aren't enjoying it then
nobody's even experiencing what i'm
creating so what do i do so this is like
uh this is from nomad in the chat and i
just want to like start talking about
this and
kind of um
give a little bit of personal context
actually not not just like kind of
informational technical like i usually
do because i am a person who deals with
a lot of criticism
and uh particularly uh i have dealt with
it a lot in the past
and uh in in a few contests so i when i
was uh running clg and dignitas i was
running them in an executive level so
when i made decisions all the decisions
that i made for the company were very
public so for example if i decided to
like kick a player or something from it
from a team that would be a decision
that would like invariably get thousands
of comments on reddit and and would uh
you know and people would like add their
their take into it and then um once i
started creating content you i had the
when i played games i would have the
sort of critique of my gameplay
criticisms i'd have the critique of my
stream criticisms and then when i went
into what i do now which is i basically
uh for lack of a better word i educate
right i talk or i talk about subjects
that are that are interesting with the
goal of educating and the goal of
exploring those topics further i now get
criticized on that level so i i have
critique that comes in for both
the information that i do the data that
i have or don't have and the um and the
way that i present that data okay so
i've pretty much experienced criticism
at every level from from a a business
standpoint to a consecration standpoint
to a um to a gameplay standpoint and i
can i can tell you what i've found
so the way that i think about criticism
is on three levels and i'm gonna go over
those levels now
level number one
is what's called high level criticism
um level number two
uh and i'm gonna put a little
thing in here uh constructive criticism
low level constructive criticism
and this is uh dumpster fire
non-constructive
criticism
um i'll go from the bottom up okay so
uh
it goes without saying that you should
pay
literally zero attention to
dumpster-fire non-constructive criticism
this is something that is easy to say
but i really want you to listen as a
business owner and a content creator
because it took me years to understand
this the people that are just throwing
kindling into your fire
provide no value to you
as a creator an artist or a business
owner and when i say no value i don't
mean that sorting through 100 comments
and finding one that's a bit of critique
on how to better do a thumbnail is
valuable it is not valuable and here's
the reason it isn't valuable
the reason it isn't valuable
is because creation
is not
inspired from
a community creation comes from i i
guess what you would call the muse
inside of yourself and the desire to
build or produce or make something into
the world
so when you go look for
creation like your creation your art
your art your content your business you
look for that outside of yourself
you can be inspired by other sources but
you can't be informed by other sources
so for example you might read a book
that explains a better way to do
business or you might be inspired by a
topic like as of the time of this
recording dmca is a big issue
on the
uh on on twitch right now and uh one of
the leaders in our company was like hey
we could reach out to tv companies and
connect people together for tv shows
like that idea was inspired by a current
event but wasn't informed from any like
particular comment or anything like that
like when i say non-constructive
criticism
i mean people that are just saying
um this is like too bright this is two
whatever this is two whatever but um
i'm gonna explain low-level criticism
before i keep going on because i think
it's going to like inform like the rest
of this like case i'm making so
low-level criticism this basically just
means like everyone's saying anything
about your um
your product service or business
or content okay
low-level content constructive cysticism
is anyone who is not
an authority
saying something about your product
service business content
even in a constructive
way see i also think
that you should never ever pay attention
to these people either this is going to
be like this is like the huge take and i
know that like people will disagree with
this so i think very few people will say
but there will still be people that are
like no like there's value in reading
like every comment like like it's there
um
i will also say
that
following the authority that anyone who
is not an authority on something that is
a product service business content has
absolutely zero value to you okay
because the
net
mental power that you have to donate to
sorting through the negativity to get to
the point where
you
get something valuable from this kind of
criticism
is not worth the time because that time
has a higher opportunity cost if you are
just creating or you are just
making something happen in your business
or you are doing something that
generates you income like the i never
read youtube comments i post everything
on twitter and then i deliberately ghost
my comments um if i do anything i go to
the verified tab and i look at how
people respond there and then i respond
to some of those people not because
they're verified but because that
verification usually puts them in a
position of authority saying something
about my product service or business or
content that might be relevant okay so i
i put zero stock into social media i put
zero stock into um what people say that
don't have any kind of authority
if you haven't and like just like i have
in the years of business that i've done
and the experience that i have
if a person has not personally
experienced and gone through this they
have
next to zero value to be able to tell
you anything about what you're doing and
i i know that might come off as like um
pretentious or or arrogant or whatever
but the way that i view content creation
and the way that i view creating
something in my business is
i just
do not have the time or mental bandwidth
to accept negativity from anyone who is
not
um
very informed on what i'm doing
and what i have found is that highly
successful people
do not like to criticize other people
the reason highly successful people do
not like to criticize other people is
they know
that criticism holds people back from
doing the thing
and oftentimes the the thing you need to
do is the thing right you you don't need
to read more stuff you don't need to
consume more youtube videos you don't
need to consume more content you
definitely don't need to consume more
criticism most people just have to do
the thing they have to do and there's a
great quote that says that um success
comes from doing many ordinary things
consistently and i truly believe that
and most successful people believe that
and that has been our experience with
creating successful results so
we i know that if i'm if i criticize
somebody
and particularly if i criticize a
successful person that i i may be
contributing to the um
to the friction
that that that exists between their
ability to do that thing
and their ability to execute and their
idea so if i ruin somebody so for
example like i i'll give you a direct
example of this i used to tell people to
not stream okay like i i used to tell
people that would come into my community
they would be like hey i'm a twitch
broadcaster uh just getting started um
and i i like just by the way that they
would type it and like like you know
i've been thinking that streaming for a
couple of months um i want to do this
game in this category by the way that
they were thinking about it i knew they
didn't have a shot they had no chance of
being successful like zero chance right
i can see that because i've just gone
through thousands of people and i know
if a person is going to be able to have
it or not most people don't have it
so
um
i would tell them
the whole diatribe i'd say look like
statistically you are going to like five
in 20 000 people ever even see any kind
of income out of this remotely like you
have no shot like you should not do this
and then a lot of those people might
listen to me and i would be right and
they would go do something more
productive but what i realized was that
if they just made the mistake
i didn't criticize them and i said okay
good luck like you should give it a shot
right the experience they would gain for
that
that repertoire of experience and the
act of doing something even failing at
doing something was more important than
stopping it so i stopped telling people
that right because i realized that
criticism will always increase the
friction between you and your ability to
execute on the thing that you need to do
for that reason you should not allow
criticism and negative [ __ ] into your
headspace you should do everything you
possibly can to stop it and i understand
how extreme of a take that is but i am
telling you as a person who has dealt
with criticism on almost every level you
can deal with including like
the the highest level that people
consider a lot of criticism from and
people actually hire from sports because
sports is win lose you you there is like
it's not like oh our revenue is down 20
this quarter we suck a little bit it's
like we lost the tournament we are out
every all of our fans hate us they're
asking for roster replacements they're
asking for the ceo to step down that
level of criticism right you cannot
allow negativity into your mind space
right so in the example of the guy who i
read his question nomad and he was
talking about dungeons and dragons right
you need to create that world
that's a that's a purely creative
enterprise right that's like art
basically right which is similar to
consecration and things like that right
you need to create that world
outside of any of the constructive
criticism of anyone who is not an
authority on that subject now if you've
got a dm that is like powerful or you
know matt mercer comes through the door
and says like here's some ways you can
improve your world which again he'll be
hesitant to do because he just wants to
encourage you to do more dnd so that you
he gets you out there but if he did do
that you listen okay that's high level
constructive criticism we're going to
talk about in a minute but if it's
anything beyond that which includes your
players who are not personally dungeons
masters themselves and have not run the
experience of doing several campaigns
throw it out and and build creativity
into your world and justify it by your
own axioms and you will be more
successful and if anybody doesn't like
that you just don't deal with that
person which is another difficult thing
that people don't understand is uh is
that like way too many of you are trying
to please everybody and you're just
you're trying to you're trying to do a
thing where it's like okay well some
people aren't happy with my content i
should change my content no right there
are like so um a common um
theme in in the discord community for me
for example
is that my videos are too long people
don't like the fact that i just sit here
and i talk about things point by point
that i sometimes go on tangents or
whatever um and that my videos are
literally 40 minutes right and do you
think my response to them is you're
right i should create highly curated six
to 12-minute content
that um
uh delivers stuff in a in a solid way
now would i get more views if i did that
absolutely like blah blah blah guess
what i don't give a [ __ ] i tell them to
go [ __ ] themselves i tell them not only
to go [ __ ] themselves but i tell them
specifically do not ever say this in my
community again right because i will
create this stuff in my vision and i'll
i'll create the thing that i want and
then i will be my own worst critic
because you will always be your own
worst critic i will be the person that
gives myself that criticism as i
introspectively look at every video look
at the analytics look at the stats and
say this is the this is the result and
this is the things i need to change you
do not need anybody to come in and tell
you that stuff and you should disregard
it because the mental damage it will do
to you right i just posted a a big thing
in my discord community uh as at the
time of this recording in my
announcements channel i just said hey uh
this is actually a perfect example for
this uh this video where i went in hard
and i just said look i'm tired of people
attacking my videos where i'm not there
to defend them um
sometimes the concerts are productive
but usually it's just like it's just a
waste of time i just said i'll instantly
kick people to do this so i'm kicking
them because the mindset that they bring
on to me by their shitty construct like
none of these people are content
creators none of these people have have
any kind of success at that level right
but they're just dumpstering up my
videos because
they think um or or my points or
whatever right i have no time for that
like it's it's fine if they like like
they have those opinions but i don't
want that infecting my mental space that
would cause me any friction to create my
next thing or to do my next thing i'm
too busy on the track i don't have
[ __ ] time for that right and that
should be your mentality you don't have
time it doesn't matter if 50
or 90
or whatever of your consumer base leaves
right if you are building something in
your vision you should keep doing it
okay and you should that's not to say
that you shouldn't respond to market
indicators or or things like the stats
that are telling you right like if
you're if your stats are if you're
getting low ctr in your youtube videos
you should improve your um
you should improve your thumbnails if
you're getting um
if you're getting a low retention or or
like you know 50 returns on the product
that you're selling you should you
should be evaluating the product right
those are obvious things and you know
that you don't need anybody to tell you
that stuff the numbers will tell you
that stuff right like the numbers will
tell you if nobody's buying your product
and the market is speaking right and the
market is the best critic
along with yourself so you use those two
things like be informed by the market i
i i'm fully convinced
every single content creator i mean
every single content creator could build
a 10 million subscriber youtube channel
simply off of two things right
their own self-criticism and
introspection of how to create their
content better and number two
the analytics that youtube provides
exactly the same with your business
if you have a shopify right
all the analytics for shopify are there
your your quick throughs people that are
landing where people are leaving
everything right
your own criticism and shopify that's
all you need now go do the thing like
everything else is going to increase
your friction to um to like to your end
goal which is just to like produce okay
now the one exception to this is high
level constructive criticism
from an authority okay
high level means a mentor experienced
person
or
strong
learned individual on the topic
on the on on the product
service business or content
in a constructive way
so if you have the opportunity to get in
front of a highly successful person who
has done the thing you have done before
preferably many times listen to that
person right right now i guarantee you
that person will never dumpster anything
or if they do dumpster it they'll tell
you why and then they'll give you
constructive criticism
they'll give you real constructive work
so i can prove it like there are many
times that somebody has come in front of
me and said i need money for this or i
have this business idea and i say this
is trash like like this will never work
right but if you implement these things
and consider these things here's
where i think that could go right and
maybe even then it's appropriate to tell
people to
go [ __ ] themselves right because there
has been no number of people that
thought that uber was a terrible idea
and many people that are unbelievably
successful marketers like tim ferriss or
gary vaynerchuk passed on the first
couple rounds of uber and regret it
right just didn't seem like it made
sense like so you might have an idea
that you think is really good and even
the high level critics are able to knock
it down and you just keep going it's
fine but um
when a lot of people don't know this but
like when nova the agency started we
originally started as a platform for
influencers so the idea was we were
going to create a website where you as a
brand could automatically connect
through a pipeline with an influencer
and so both would register accounts on
either side and they would connect well
we took that idea to silicon valley and
to investors and we got annihilated
people hated that idea right and as a
result of that
that we did not do that idea because we
we decided that the high-level
constructive criticism from those people
who had done it before who had uh seen
it in their portfolios and were aware of
the competition were informed enough
that we should not do that idea and it
turned out that was 100 the right play
and now the idea we're doing at novo as
a creative agency is way better okay so
high level constructive criticism can
actually save you a lot of time and
money and and stress and and
less higher higher cortisol levels and
everything else right so
um it's good in that sense but you don't
always have to listen to it but the the
like
high-level criticism meaning like you
should really be listening to people who
again have done the thing a lot and
really understand the intricacy of it
right even learned people um like people
who spend there's such a huge difference
between people who spend a lot of time
reading about particularly in this world
now reading about something and doing
something the difference between people
who are actually working on
cryptocurrency and nfts versus the
people that are reading about it on like
wikipedia and and like reddit and stuff
like that is night and day so be careful
with experts right i consider an expert
only now today as a person who is
dealing
with the thing i do not care how many
youtube videos you've watched even
though i do think that like a person
could be informed by youtube videos like
that's how i started learning about
cryptocurrency but now i'm an investor i
work on different projects i connect nft
projects together i do all kinds of
stuff in the crypto world right so i am
a person who works there like i i i work
in it i earn money off it i can show you
money that i have made in the
cryptocurrency space not from percentage
returns of investing but actually
working on back-end deals through
networks like ethereum right so um
you should be looking for people
and like an obvious one for like
consecration is like okay well just like
how many subscribers this youtuber have
right like like or how many people have
they like directly helped build that
like in my case right like you just like
that's the resume right um if a person
is coming to you and saying
oh like here's how to make a better
thumbnail and then like you click on
their youtube and they've got like 50
subscribers like you'd be like dude like
like okay like because and this is by
the way this is like also a thing where
um there was a while back when i sold um
clg
i i got outreach to
buy it was really funny like when you
sell a company and it's on it's a it's
public data so it's like like because
massive square garden was a is a public
company right um everybody knows who
sold it so what ends up happening is
that every single bank like 150 emails
the day you sell come in and they're
like hi like we saw you sold a company
um we're really interested in like
talking to you about your portfolio like
what are you gonna do with that money
like like you know you ever thought
about investing it and you get like
messages like wells fargo and like bank
of america i didn't know this but like
that like this happened right so i
entertained calls with a lot of these
these these people the people that will
manage money okay and the question i
always ask them was um
how much of your own money do you manage
and and like what have you succeeded in
doing like like and then the other
question the follow-up question that
which is a real fun question is like if
you
uh
are
so good at getting exponential returns
from the market why do you work for
wells fargo right it's a really hard
question to answer and that's another
question you ask like a content creator
like if you're so good at making
thumbnails why do you have 50
subscribers why don't you just do these
yourself now their answer may be um well
i don't want to like create the content
side of it because like for example we
have like a lot of really great content
cred uh sorry we have a little great
thumbnail artists in the lab who just
don't create content i mean they're not
like this is not their interest but
they're very good grass designers so
they might have an answer for you which
could be like well i worked on this
youtubers um
youtube which which has 500 000
subscribers there you go right but again
some experience you see that i'm like
like vetting people in the space it is
so important to vet these people because
um no matter how much reading or youtube
videos or whatever i don't care if you
watched every video on like here's how
clickbait works on youtube
you don't know it truly know it until
you've been through it like i just can
tell you right um
and that is where you you should uh
you should um
focus only if you are going to focus at
all but that's that's the west in this
video is i really think that the vast
majority of criticism is including
constructive criticism you should just
throw out right and there are
incredibly successful people who do not
engage at all
with um at
any level
with criticism joe rogan is a great
example where he has the post and ghost
philosophy where like he just puts it
out there and then he leaves right and i
love that philosophy i use it for
twitter i use it for like a lot of like
articles i write i just i just don't
read the stuff that comes because again
i don't want any friction between that
that that my ability to execute and the
ability to um
and my ability to execute and like the
idea that i have i just like that's got
to be as thin as possible it's already
so hard to like create and to put stuff
out there to build a product or things
like that right like um particularly and
for people for those of you that run
product-based businesses and
service-based businesses high-level
constructive criticism is more valuable
for those of you that are content
creators um
constructive criticism is almost
worthless uh the the the stats that are
provided uh to you as a content creator
on most platforms are
more than enough to make informed
decisions on what you should do next and
you already know the things you should
be doing you're most likely using this
commentary as a means of procrastination
that is keeping you from doing the thing
that you should be doing and on top of
that you are also adding the negativity
to justifying subconsciously or
consciously the um
the the not doing of those things uh
this is not good stop doing that uh and
the vast majority of you would benefit
largely from just eliminating criticism
from your life just like
like like one of the reasons why
i stopped doing so much live content was
because i couldn't control the flow of
criticism so i i just i just get
criticism from this chat and just be
stupid uninformed things that like i
know for a fact just like don't work and
this would like
non my negativity and and now i can
control those things in a lot better
form because like i created chats where
i'm more accessible um i i have a
discord which is like like sort of like
a gate right and there's like a lot of
paid opportunities to engage with me and
things like that and and just like makes
your life better right so yeah um don't
add more friction into your life
on things that you need to do and
execute on there's already like way more
than enough uh and it turns out that i
actually think that this is like one of
the more important videos that i made so
i hope even if there's a lot of people
out there that are gonna think you know
what criticism is great um everybody can
benefit from criticism uh i i just like
i i appreciate you i understand i was
once like you um i have now been through
tens of thousands of comments that
they're personally from everything from
like um how i do my hair to my i don't
know some part of my body being too big
on my face um to
literal like multi-page essays about
like how i'm running a business or how
i'm doing something in particular and
where i'm wrong and like i can tell you
it's not worth it man this is it's like
it didn't
at the end of the day if i look back on
the i've been creating content for
uh
10 years
right it's 2022 now 10 years yeah and um
i i look at okay how much
how much of my work in my businesses in
my life my product services got better
because of the dumpster fire of reddit
comments and the amount of time i spent
reading those zero none right i look at
my esports players and i say how much of
how much of their gameplay skill got
better as a result of reading reddit
threads about how they threw top lane
zero none okay like it doesn't help you
reduce the amount of things in your life
that keep you from
being able to execute uh as much as
possible and and criticism includes that
so um give this a shot even if you think
i'm wrong and you will be surprised by
the results of just keeping in
confidence like high-level productive
people and successful people in um in in
your circles that will also encourage
you to keep those people around you um
rather than like hang out with in that
dumpster fire places you should spend
your time around people who are
iterative and and really thinking
carefully about things and and are
driven towards success because that is a
whole other topic but in of itself will
increase your success by being around
those people instead of this dumpster
fire of just like everybody having an
opinion on the internet okay let me know
what you think i might not read it bye
