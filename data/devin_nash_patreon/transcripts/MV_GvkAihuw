okay so i need to do a video about good
versus bad data and how you can source
that data as a resource for your
business or your life this is a really
important video because people need to
know how to interpret information and
particularly what information is
reliable in business and what isn't so
this conversation started
because i need to give you kind of a
background before we explain this in our
discord mastermind chat where we were
reviewing a pitch deck and the pitch
deck claimed that the total crater
economy is 104 billion dollars that is
to say that like all influencers and the
money they make is 104 billion dollars
and i took issue with that i said that
that is not a true number and then um
another independent party biased
observer
us actually looked into the data and
found that the 104 billion dollar
marketing number comes from an
influencer marketinghub.com website
where they
basically try to break down and uh
summarize why they think the economy of
craters is this high but if you actually
break down the data you'll you'll see
that um
there is like actually no basis for this
number that they just sort of estimated
it they only surveyed two thousand
creators and somehow from those critters
they determined that um
those 2000 creators made an average of
108 thousand dollars a year which really
questions like who they surveyed or or
for what purpose right and you get this
idea of a creator economy that is is
just a total falsity right this is just
absolutely a not true statement um so
i want to uh illustrate that as an
example of bad data and then provide you
an example of like really good data and
then we'll kind of break down like how
how your thinking can change and like
what data i actually use to inform
business decisions so okay um
commander roots said in uh in quarter
in quarter four of 2021 that twitch
currently had two thousand four hundred
thirty nine thousand thousand three and
seventy six affiliates and sixty two
thousand five hundred twenty nine
partners so this is a very reliable
source of data because this is a bot
that aggregates every single user on
twitch so this just objectively is the
number right this is good data but what
if i took this data and i said there are
62 529 people who make full-time income
on twitch because we assume that twitch
partners make full-time income is that
true well no there's probably less than
five thousand four thousand right i'm
guessing uh people that actually make
any kind of meaningful income that are
in that partner category because most of
those account once you're a partner you
never get de-partnered so most of those
accounts are dead or they aren't making
any money or they're dead partners
that's the vast majority of partner
accounts are dead so see even if our
initial data source is good um
extrapolating data from it can be wrong
and for this reason
i want to start breaking down the kind
of data that um is useful versus the
kind of data that isn't so there are
really two types of data that i want to
concern with for this video and number
one is data-driven results
from
esoteric or third-party
sources
and number two is data-driven
results
from
personal experience
personal assets or company
okay or internal company
data okay so
um
i cannot stress enough
how ambiguous and how uncertain number
one is in our current ecosystem there
is not just in business but in life in
general now there are some
empirically backed double-blind really
reliable studies
in the area of like medicine for example
where we can form certain conclusions
okay smoking cigarettes is bad for you
right drinking excessive amounts of
alcohol is bad for you things like that
but
the more granular that we go with that
the more vague it gets right is eating
red meat batter good is um eating
xyz diet bad or good right is uh eating
once a day or three times dig it like we
don't really know the results of these
things and the individual um
the individual
consistency of like every human being is
so different that like it varies even
across genetic profiles and on and on
right so in exactly the same way in
business we can't make decisions
unless we have incredibly reliable data
like posting consistently on social
media is a good thing for your brand
unless your artesian builds and then you
like you know you blow it up but like
within reason that's like that's a good
assumption to make but it's like is it
better to stream on twitch or or youtube
is it better like these are start to
become very individualized decisions
right so what i want to caution
everybody from doing is using a stat
like twitch is has the highest number of
affiliates and partners the most amount
of people stream on twitch therefore
um the
best place to stream is on twitch right
that's not true so we need to build a
system of what's called axioms which are
uh fundamental
pillars of truth
that we can rely on
so like a classic one
is um
if you say statement one right
the streets are what
and statement two
it rained today
um
and then statement three
is
the streets are wet because of the rain
right is this objectively true well
maybe not maybe the streets dried and
somebody hoes them down right we can't
make that statement based on these two
axioms right or this should be really a
conclusion
so what you should do every single time
that you're presented with some kind of
data is you should make sure that the
fundamental pillars of that data are
true right so breaking down the
fundamental pillars of the last argument
right um
there are 65
529 twitch partners
okay right a twitch partner is someone
who has made some income off twitch
and then it's like
okay and then this conclusion is
there are
65-day full-time income
people on twitch see when i lay this out
like this you can see the fallacies but
like other people will do this very
periodically like everybody assuming the
twitch partner makes full-time income
and they'll see that the fundamental
pillars of this truth are not accurate
right so when you're analyzing any kind
of data from a third-party resource or
like you have to go break down the
fundamental uh pillars of that truth so
that you can figure out
where it breaks down and what you'll
find is that the huge majority of these
uh third-party sources especially when
it comes to business or social media are
false so in medicine
we have
at least the united states and in many
countries we have both universities and
government and
funded
resources who are willing to put down uh
most of the time non-ob non-biased
opinions uh sorry non-biased data
that um but not always non-biased but
but hopefully non-biased data
that can be controlled for and in
studies so for that reason
um we can find
that
data to be more reliable but in i didn't
explain that well but like i'll i'll
keep going in marketing and in social
media and in content creation and in
business
the only reason to create data
is incentivized so
if somebody is like if somebody is
creating a number like the total crater
economy is 104 billion dollars it is
because they are incentivized to create
that number but they're incentivized to
do that study by some profit-generated
motive right you have to keep that in
mind so any third-party source or
esoteric source that generates data that
isn't internal from their company or
their own experience is doing so for a
profit-generating motive which may not
be bad because that might be fine so for
example like stream hatchet for example
which i use a lot that's that's data
that i use quite a bit is a for-profit
company that is generating data on
twitch and youtube uh in order to sell
that product uh to brands and and and
companies so they're
um
trying to find their last uh stream
elements report
a stream hatchet report but we'll just
go to the website right
so this website is incentivized to
provide good data
on
trends
because if they
their literal value add is the
reliability of this data so we can we
can then assume that these guys have
good skin in the game and this is
somebody to rely on so again we're
breaking down the fundamental pillars to
kind of get back to
what uh if we can trust this source of
data or not okay and then based on that
we can make a decisions but so what's
let's um let's assume though that we've
actually found a reliable source of data
and we can we can look at stream hatchet
or something so i'll go through like my
video on stream hatchet i guess it's
just the easiest way to access this
report because it's not in my immediate
downloads and i have no idea um so what
anyway so i cover this report here and i
give some uh and like you know you'll
see some stats here like okay
what is the leading western part
platform for watch time where do people
watch stuff well they watch stuff on
twitch right as far as live streaming
goes so does that mean i should stream
on twitch right even though we now have
a reliable source of data we still can't
draw that conclusion from that because
streaming there's a million different
reasons why you might want to stream on
this platform or run a business on this
platform or not right if you actually
break it down and you've watched enough
of me you'll know that streaming on
twitch is actually one of the worst
places to stream right because there's
other data points that confound it
but even still
even with me saying that streaming on
twitch for you individually may not may
be the right thing to do right despite
the fact that it is highly unlikely that
you might succeed there you may have a
competitive advantage that allows you to
succeed there so um all in all all of
the data-driven results that you get
even from legitimate sources so even if
you qualify the sources are
almost not worth your time okay so
basically from this we can just be
completely nihilistic and say okay a
huge amount of the data out there even
the data that can be considered accurate
is not going to be useful to you uh and
you should not make business decisions
based on that external data is like the
number one takeaway of this video if you
get anything out of this video it's that
do not use these giant macro statistics
that um even if they are legitimate do
not affect you directly because they
represent a macrocosm of an industry so
you know two million creators that
number doesn't affect you you're one
creator with one community two million
critters doesn't affect you you'll never
touch that number in any meaningful way
okay so what does matter
well the first thing that matters is
experience
the one of the one of the main reasons
that people listen to me and i'm
considered an authority on this subject
is because i'm my hands are in the dirt
every day doing this so i am running
deals i'm running uh i'm i'm talking
back and forth with influencers i'm
doing
the contracts i'm talking to the brands
and i'm getting feedback and i can
aggregate my own assumptions of the
industry based on that feedback right so
there's a certain subjective way of
thinking
that i think directs the majority of
very successful people that i
um encounter
most uh
most of them have personal experience in
what they're doing so they're actually
doing the thing right so
uh looking at a stream hatchet's report
and then determining the best place to
stream
versus going and multi-streaming to
three places right you would intuitively
know that multi-streaming to those three
places
is going to be vastly superior to
looking at a report
you just have to do the thing
likewise if you're going to run like an
ad campaign throwing 15 at bing google
and facebook for
two weeks is going to teach you
infinitely more than any amount of
articles that you
end up reading on these subjects we tend
to consume articles and consume youtube
videos because it's much easier than
doing the thing so we don't actually run
the data and we don't actually know i
think this is why i run into so many
people that don't know what they're
talking about what it what when i
actually there's so few people that can
toe to toe
on real ads and like you'll just know
immediately when somebody can because
they're doing it right and like their
experience might be different but it
will be very valuable versus where
somebody's experience where they're
parodying something they've read or
something they've googled is like much
less valuable okay so um you can gain
from personal experience but the other
thing you can do and this is something
that like is you can gain subjective
experience
from
thought leaders so i've tried to create
my twitter
uh to do this surprisingly like i've i i
think i've like finally made the
platform
a an actual like decent place to be
um i'll use like one example of a person
where uh this is a guy named sahil bloom
uh and and mastermind in our discord has
talked about this guy where he will
periodically do
um
just tweets about interesting things
like tweet threads like how to get lucky
and then this will be
a um sort of a business-minded approach
to
how to to to um
to how to like actually create luck in
like a business sense he'll do a lot of
these kind of um sort of deep dives into
things so what i have done is i've sort
of created a community of thought
leaders in the sort of business web 3
and marketing world uh just by gradually
following people that are produ that are
in their experience i judge
should i follow them or not by what
they're actually doing
um are you making millions of dollars in
the in the market industry like right
that's a person that i should follow are
you running like a brand like a huge
division of a brand's uh marketing like
these are these are people you should
pay attention to right and you should
gain a list of these people and you
should actually trust their results over
third-party data so for example one of
the reasons why i'm looking at tick-tock
as an agency lately is it because i have
read like a bunch of data on tick tock's
total user base and engagement rates and
stuff like that it isn't because of that
it's because i see
many of my colleagues and people who are
very prominent in the influencer
industry are paying attention to tick
tock and most of the creators that are
coming up are paying attention to tick
tock you have to watch what people do
and you have to watch like how people
act and this is really counter-intuitive
to like um a
many people who are listening to this
will be like what like you're basically
telling me to ignore like third-party
sources and data and i'm more or less i
am telling you that right if you can't
drive the data from your own experience
or your company's experience
then your next best shot is not to go
out and like look to like studies from
social media hubs and stuff like that
which are always incentivized and are
not reliable the next best thing you can
do is go out to individual thought
leaders who are actually doing the thing
and there are thought leaders who are
not doing the thing
there's lots of them right like how many
of you have run into like a motivational
speaker who is just not got their life
together and not created great success
right that's like not a person you want
to pay attention to any more than like
um a a person who is just not in
practice of the thing that they're doing
right there are tons and tons of experts
who
are are either trying to sell you
something or they don't actually put
their hands in the mud so the first
thing you need to look at is like does
this person have their hands in the mud
are they doing something right if i'm
looking for a person on twitter to
follow or a person on linkedin to listen
to about pay-per-click ads you better be
sure that person is running like fifty
thousand hundred thousand dollars a
quarter at least in pay-per-click ads
and then they can tell me something
about it hopefully in many different
relevant industries right so if you gain
subjective experience from thought
leaders that's step two number one is
your own experience number two is
subjective experience from thought
leaders it will help you a lot you
should create a list of people who are
really really smart in the topics that
you're interested in in
what so for fitness for example right i
have tim ferriss right i have thomas day
lower right science
data data backed people who are going to
do the work that are ex but are also
experts right um just to use thomas de
lauer as like a great example of like
fitness
um because i i'll use him quite a bit
this is a guy who will break down data
but also he lives the life right i mean
you can take a look at him this is a guy
that like is uh is is super put together
in terms of like his actual life and
fitness profile right he knows what he's
doing he does this every day but he's
also provides all the sources like so
there's a lot of like thought leaders in
every individual area that are like this
right i strive to be a thought leader in
the area of marketing and attention
economy for for for this purpose right
um
in in that i try to qualify myself by
the things i'm trying to tell you to
qualify for when you're looking for
experts which is like my hands are in it
right i run an agency i do millions of
dollars of deals every year i i i talk
to dozens and dozens of top tier
creators across every platform i what
right like i'm in this right i'm talking
to agencies i'm talking to hollywood i'm
i'm doing i'm doing all this stuff right
in like web 3 um who am i looking at i'm
looking at someone like vitalik right
like someone that's in that's running
the ethereum network and like what
they're looking at i'm also looking at
like um visionary thought leaders like
justin khan right like people who um
uh who are like who created a massive
platform like twitch and are now
building like actual funded web3
enterprises right these are these are
things that i want to pay attention to
right these are the kind of people that
i'm looking so curate a list of thought
leaders and experts in your fields that
will that will steer you the right way
and trust those sources over third-party
sources unless you have a third-party
source that is like super well
controlled double-blind and can explain
exactly how they got to those results
and then
nothing is more important than actually
doing the thing right that's step one so
build a a set of truths based on the um
the the experience and make sure that
each step makes sense the experience
that you have because
if you if you use the wrong data to
inform your company and life decisions
you will
fail like actually um
so many businesses and so many people
are making decisions based on
either other people's interpretation of
like what's right or wrong or just flat
out numbers and and this
will not help you
and you will get smoked by people who
are
like actually using the real data to
inform the decisions
and this requires mentally
a kind of break from
um the norm you have to be willing
to throw away any conception without
attachment
or any argument with that attachment
that you might be attached to
so that is to say like
you might i i might have thought
here's a good example right like i
started streaming in 2012
and i streamed till 2015 i assumed to
get in 2018
it really sucks to know that if i had
put all that time into youtube and
cross-platform diversification i would
be 100 times the influencer that i am
today but that's just i have to detach
myself from that reality because like
that reality is keeping dozens and
dozens if not hundreds of partner twitch
streamers as we speak stuck on the
platform doing the same stupid stream
every eight hours a day right eight
hours a day same stream same community
go to socialblade they're losing
followers every day
why because they're doing the same thing
every day because they can't detach
themselves from the notion that they
wasted their time they have a sunk cost
fallacy it's true for so many people in
business there's so many retail stores
that are in bad locations that are still
running their stuff saying okay i'm
losing money every month but maybe it'll
turn around there's so many like sas
products and so many service-based and
product-based products that you're just
not looking at the data so you have to
there's both a spiritual aspect of
business and a a real one and the
spiritual aspect is you have to detach
from these results and say okay
everything is up in the air as a as soon
as a fundamental pillar that i thought
was true is proven wrong i need to shift
and i need to and that's the definition
of agility that's the definition of like
being fast is you have to be able to
shift as soon as like a fundamental
pillar of truth gets shaken
to build new pillars so that you can be
stronger so i just want everybody to be
really careful with the way that they
look at data and
and what they use to inform those
decisions because 99.9 of it is
i really hope this helps and it's not
just rambling thank you for watching
