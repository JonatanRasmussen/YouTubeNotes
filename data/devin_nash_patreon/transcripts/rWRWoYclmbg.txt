okay today we are going to talk about
inertia
versus action
the most valuable business skill and so
to begin i want to define inertia
because inertia is a physics term but i
also really love it from the standpoint
of productivity and getting things done
i think if you internalize the concept
in this video
it will be the most effective thing you
can do from a business or
self-oriented standpoint
and i mean that that's a big statement
but i think it's true inertia is a
property of a body by virtue of which it
opposes any agency that attempts to put
it into motion or if it is moving to
change the magnitude or direction of its
velocity so that is a super technical
definition but i really love the part
where it says opposes any agency that
attempts to put it into motion
inertia is something that we deal with
outside of physics in our minds every
single day there are all kinds of things
that are preventing us from putting
things into motion or putting things
into action and this is the primary
struggle of anybody that's trying to
start a business or anybody that is
trying to do anything in the real world
no matter what your level of success is
so today i want to talk about this
concept by
outlining
a person who i think is
the example of the best inertia versus
inertia action person that i know
and i'm gonna when i say inertia to
action what i mean is from a state of
doing nothing or even being opposed to
doing something how do you turn
something into a real result in the
world result being that something is
produced something is created a product
is offered something is exchanged there
is something available to be transacted
upon there is a service created there's
a contract created there is something
that is physically in the world
the largest problem that we have in
moving to a sort of digital landscape
is that most people do not act they live
in a world of like um ephemeral things
ethereal things they're things that
don't actually produce anything they
don't even produce things into the
digital world which could still be a
result because that can initiate a
transaction or action they're
taking actions that don't actually
produce results they're they're they're
watching videos or they're um consuming
something or
they're just wasting time there's
there's a million different ways to
waste time and if you take a if you take
a
i guess a like a a category like a
calendar of what
you are doing on a day-to-day basis a
log you'll see that there are all these
things you're probably doing to waste
time because even the most effective
people i know have these problems okay
so let's go back to that example and
who am i going to use well i decided
that i wanted to use the richest person
in the world which is elon musk right
now
elon musk is a super interesting
character he has there's a lot to talk
about from him in a marketing
perspective but today i'm just talking
about his ability to
commit things into action and you're
going to see what i mean when i outline
a timeline for you so
this
timeline here is going to be for twitter
and just the the whole process of what
has
happened since we have heard about what
has happened in twitter i think it'll be
really interesting for you and you'll
kind of see this concept in action it
should be a better way let me just kind
of explain it so january uh 31st this is
before
the public
heard about twitter or anything about it
elon buys five percent of the company
and nobody really batted it out of this
there was no significant news about it
but january 31st is where he first
bought shares of the company now march
24th which is
about two months later
he starts the marketing campaign so take
a look at this
given that twitter serves as a de facto
public town square failing to adhere to
the free speech principles fundamentally
undermines democracy what should be done
is a new platform needed now keeping in
mind that he already owns five percent
at uh of twitter at this point
by
april fourth which is just seven days
later or so about a week later he owns
nine percent and those shares become
public
and on the same day he's invited to join
the board of twitter
but three days later he refuses
the board offer
and then
five days later
he offers to buy the company
like sincere offer right
for 45 billion dollars
and then three days after that
or uh five days after that
he retains
morgan stanley
to push a deal
offering 15 billion of his own money and
the rest of being like bank loans and
then by april 25th which is the time of
this recording
there is news that twitter is
considering the buy
and
that this is hours away so by the time
that you watch this video
he may have
bought twitter successfully or but
regardless what i want you to look at is
the timeline so january 31st which is
the end of january is barely two months
march 24th
comes out and he has already
started
action
and then
i'll only after a week after this he
already owns nine percent and invites or
the boys this is a person who is
translating inertia into action at a
rate that we have never seen before it's
incredibly insane the logistics of
mergers and acquisitions
are so complex that they normally take
months if not years to do
likewise to
upset or change
the face of a
industry like electric cars for example
uh is unheard of has never been done
much less than the time frames that
somebody like elon has done them so
let's take another look at this before i
kind of break down into into the concept
let's look at tesla so with tesla tesla
used to be a company that had a ceo and
a co-founder it didn't do anything it
didn't do anything for many years but in
2004 elon joined
and then by 2008 so four years later he
pushed out every
other exec and became sole ceo so four
years he did that and then in 2010 just
two years later he raised 226 million
dollars
and then
um in an ipo so so he also ipo in that
time right
and then by 2020 so 10 years later the
share price is 900
and he dominates the ec market
despite the fact that there are
tons of incumbents and people that had
every reason to be able to out-compete
him so the way so make no mistake this
is i think tesla even is a better
example of what i'm talking about than
twitter because tesla had so many heavy
competitors you had ford you had gm you
had unbelievable competitors toyota
everybody across the world could have
done what elon did but in just under 20
years
not even right just under 15 years he
built the largest electric car company
even even i doubted it because of the
incumbents right at the time uh that
around 2015
i was very bearish tesla because i was
like there's no way that these companies
on the other side
of this competition are going to let
this happen they have every reason all
the money all the resources everything
every every single advantage they have
the biggest battalion by far toyota was
producing
like 450 to one some insane number there
was no reason they want this happen so
why did this stuff happen why did tesla
dominate like this
what occurred
and i and the answer to that is the idea
of inertia to action so what elon has
done successfully to create value at the
highest level possible he has created
action on an enormous scale that no one
else has ever duplicated in the in the
history of humanity the his ability to
take an idea like we're gonna dig a hole
under the los angeles and then get that
moving is a and then and then move it to
actual completion to something physical
in the world like there are holes that
he has dug under los angeles that has
happened and he somehow pushed through
the government pushed through everything
that would have taken years and years
and years to get that done
launched rockets right all this stuff
and i the funny thing is when you look
at how he's actually done this stuff
there's no there's nothing about it in
his interviews and and to kind of get
into his mind i i there's a great thread
if i can find it or somebody can find it
post it on the comment section
there was a great thread about how he
was able to
like
do all these things there's like maybe
20 or 30
different
interviews about his mindset i'll try to
find it and post it if i can find it in
this notes but the point was i've
listened to a lot of interviews with e1
as i do with a lot of successful people
there doesn't seem to be almost any talk
about how he does this so
this is the the real answer this is the
real skill is is like being able to
translate something into action to beat
red tape to beat your own mind right and
i think that at different levels of
success there is different levels of
solving this problem so at elon's level
of success that's not relevant to any of
us he's got to find ways to push through
bureaucratic stuff like governments he's
got to find ways to push through getting
hundreds of employees to do things and
those are really hard problems for
ourselves like the start is just pushing
through the
inertia
of our own mind right
which is just
how do you get out of your own head and
and you're going to realize a couple of
things that i want to offer you that
about this because this is like probably
where the vast majority of us sit i mean
even like me i have some
there's some inertia in my company but
at the size of our company which is
around 15 employees right now pretty
much the entire problem is just all the
problems in my head so i actually if
you're listening to this and like you
feel like that you know i have that
exact same problem like it's just it's
my ability to turn things into action
it's not really on anybody else at this
point and when i'm running a company of
like 70 to 100 people like i was at clg
at that point inertia starts to show up
in different places and but you can
still push it through as a manager you
can still push it through as a leader so
the principle here is that the only
thing that matters
is your speed of thought into action
right so your
ability to change thought
into action
this might be the most important thing
that i say
the only thing that matters is your
speed of thought into action your
ability to change thought into action
okay literally nothing else matters all
your plans all the stuff you have on
whatever evernote or on notepad or
whatever plans you have whatever you've
written down whatever you've planned in
your head whatever you've talked to
other people about you've probably spent
hours doing doesn't matter at all the
only thing that matters is the action
that has been taken in the physical
world is representative of your idea or
your thought so the power that human
beings have is that we can turn a
thought into something like everything
around you started as a thought and
that's amazing every desk every wall
every light everything i'm just looking
at things in my room all that stuff was
once a thought somebody had a thought to
create that company produced that thing
and so that physical thing exists
because somebody was able to push
through the inertia of their own mind
that is becoming harder in our world
because the amount of distraction and
the amount of things that are that are
holding us to not creating action is
really substantial so this is the only
thing that actually matters and once you
understand that you should be focusing
your entire day on producing those
critical actions that are going to
actually physically produce products and
services or
actions within the real world and
nothing else like whatever you have to
do to to get to that point uh which
we'll talk about in a little bit is fine
but you have to understand that those
things are middlemen at best to the
actual problem which is you are not
creating action in the world if you
could theoretically spend your day
doing
purely action-oriented things you would
be someone like elon that's the that's
the difference between him and us right
is that he is producing massive amounts
of action he's with the same amount of
time he has no more time than your eye
he has no more time than you or i we
have the exact same amount of time on
this earth we have 24 hours a day and he
spends that day working towards things
that almost purely produce action across
multiple different fields and if you
look at he's not the only one that does
that if you look at any success case
they are like this there are people that
create action at varying levels and the
people that create massive action
to borrow a tony robbins term are the
people that generally produce the most
amounts of success
so something else to understand
is like because we're kind of talking
about the realm of thought versus action
so you can kind of like separate them
into two quadrants you can you can
separate thought and then action over
here with like thought is where you want
to get away from you want to just do the
minimum amount that you need to be able
to produce your action and then your
action is where you want to sit
by the way this is true with everything
right like if you understand this
concept is not just for business or self
or like self success or whatever this is
in relationships this is in your life
everything this is your exercise
routines everything you can do you can
think about working out all you want
you're not gonna get any stronger but
your actual act of going see this like
this quadrant is so important so the
thing the next thing i think about is uh
this is a zen concept this is a one i'm
borrowing from a lot of buddhist text
most thoughts are the same thoughts
repeating over and over
if you do any kind of meditation
you'll realize that most thoughts
are the same thoughts and the same
anxieties
and you spend most of your day
in a loop
you just spend most your day in a loop
the thing that breaks these loops
are actions
and actions only so if you meditate a
decent amount of time you'll eventually
have a realization
that the thoughts that you have are
thoughts that you've thought before
and that'll mess with you and then what
will really mess with you when you do a
couple more hundred hours of meditation
is that those are the thoughts that
everybody has had billions of times
[Laughter]
throughout all of human history
and that'll take you for a ride
once you understand that you're just
having the same thoughts over and over
again you start to see the futility of
living in that place in your head it's
just this repeating stock ticker that
goes on and on and doesn't actually
produce anything furthermore the
thoughts that you're having that you've
thought about or worried about over and
over again that aren't actually
producing any kind of action or anything
in your life to fix your result are also
things that are wasting not only wasting
your time but causing you great anxiety
depression and problems because you're
just thinking these same thoughts over
and over again the things that break
these loops of thought that break these
anxieties these depressions are not
thinking more of the same thoughts you
can keep doing that for as long as you
are
going to allow yourself to do it and
nothing will change because in the realm
of thought nothing is actualized the
only things that are actualized are
actions
right and so because of that you will
need to do something other than think
to get the action
and it might not be what you think it
might not it
might not be the thing right like so
maybe the thing to do today is you've
got to send five emails but
that to get to that action you may need
to condition your mind in a different
way so that could be something like a
discipline
uh action uh meditation
some focus exercises
uh or exercise in general
improving nutrition
these are all things that you can do
that you can produce action for that
would improve your
action
and that's a weird concept right so
what i'm what i'm directly saying the
principle i'm trying to espouse here is
if you do things if you take action in
your life
it might not be the action that you take
that is the thing itself it's kind of
complex but
extra so i just like put it really
simple exercising every day is gonna
make you a more productive person right
meditating every day is gonna make you a
more productive person if you kind of
cook that over in your head you're gonna
know that intuitively but why do you
know it intuitively you know it because
you know that you are not a
just like an individual on an island
you're the sum of the
the experiences and the actions that you
do across a day and if you meditate and
your mind is more clear and you are
practicing on focus your actions at
other places will get better so
oftentimes people will take a concept
like this you might understand this
concept so far you say well great devin
i understand this concept but i still
live every day not doing anything like i
feel you i've been there 100
in that case the thing to do is start
focusing on actions that you can control
even if they're really stupid like
working out two minutes a day
or like you could do one of those
download like the seven minute workout
app and just do that right or just
meditating for five minutes like have
you got five minutes in a day like you
can do that right that you focus on
those actions that you can control
because those actions will compound to
actually get you to the point of being a
person that acts at a great level of
success so you may not be capable of
committing to an action that you want to
commit to you may need to
compartmentalize and create micro steps
of actions that you can control no
matter how insignificant that might seem
and i'm talking
when i was at my laziest and just
playing like 16 to 18 hours of video
games a day sometimes like reading two
pages of a book was a win for me over a
zero day sometimes like walking outside
was a win for me over a zero day one of
the things i used a lot was nutrition i
used nutrition because i could eat a
little bit better it's so easy to
control if i could eat a little bit
better then maybe i could improve some
other aspect of my life and just
gradually i mean like painstakingly
years and years and years i kept doing
this and i kept on it until now people
look at me and they go oh that's a
highly disciplined highly actualized
person but no i'm the sum of a bazillion
micro actions that i did so that i could
get to this point and in the exact same
way you might have to start that journey
today to be a person of massive action
to be a person of action that um
uh produces the things that you want to
in your life now you are i might have
varying levels of what you want to
produce and but i mean you have to start
the journey like depending on like what
kind of actions you want to create
and so
if i could
there's a lot of tactical stuff
that we talk about on this channel but
none of it really matters
if you can't push through the inertia of
your own mind and turn your thought into
action and this is a practice that will
never end i do this every day i did it
this morning right when i'm in the
office filming this i did this i do this
every single day
um i have other techniques that i do so
maybe those are worth it one in
particular
is i meditate a lot on the concept of
finality and death which is kind of a
heavy subject so i don't know if
everybody should do it but it helps me a
lot kind of retain focus and
persist and turn things into action i
also keep really good notes like i i
would say okay like what is going to
make me feel fulfilled today what action
would make me feel fulfilled today that
if i did it i i would go home proud i'd
say okay that was done that something is
in the world it exists it's an
improvement it's it's a change in the
actual nature of
of my reality it's not just like up here
and that's a daily practice literally a
daily practice a minute by minute
practice you will never end this battle
but understanding it is how you start
and i think the most important
aspect of success
that i can recommend so i hope this is
helpful hope it
got somebody in the right way thanks for
listening talk again soon bye
