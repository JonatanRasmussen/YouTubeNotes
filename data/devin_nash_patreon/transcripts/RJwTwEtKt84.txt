hello what i'm going to do in this video
is i am going to break down newsletter
marketing email marketing because i was
inspired to do this from the mastermind
chat over on the patreon this is a
exciting subject i actually love
newsletter marketing i'm not doing it in
my current business because my current
business isn't really b2c but my
previous two businesses were absolutely
b2c and i use newsletter marketing a lot
i think that newsletter marketing is one
of the most effective ways that you can
market i don't i think there's also a
perception in the marketing world
that email is like not used anymore and
that people aren't checking it but email
open rates are better than ever and this
is one of the really like underpriced
and kind of like free ways that you can
get a lot of attention and sales so i'm
going to go over kind of how to do that
today
if you are a person who has customers or
viewers or fans or or anything like that
a newsletter is something you might want
to consider and
there are very few businesses where a
newsletter doesn't apply the the only
place i think it doesn't apply is
probably like people that are very b2b
but even then you can have a targeted
newsletter to just a few people it'll be
really effective okay so we're not going
to just go over how to do it but just
also kind of like um i'm going to get
into some of the technicals of like
literally how to do it and how to build
it okay so first off i want to kind of
describe where newsletters are on the
funnel
and what i mean by that so if we take a
look at like your standard marketing
funnel oh this is new paint so
i have a little bit of trouble with this
we'll draw a um we'll draw this guy
and then we're going to draw this guy
and you're going to have your basic ice
cream cone funnel okay
a newsletter
sits
at the
middle of the funnel here so customer
comes in
uh through here goes the newsletter the
newsletter helps people convert either
to product based stuff down here
or um to some kind of call to action
generally if you have a newsletter you
should be selling a product through it
that i think a lot of people don't
realize that like they're doing like
updates we're going to talk about what
kind of newsletters to make and which
ones not to make and what's effective
and what's not effective okay so a lot
of the time most people when they think
about newsletters they're thinking about
okay well i want to like keep my my
customers updated or i want to do like x
y and z i actually think that for the
vast majority of newsletters the best
way to do a newsletter is actually to do
product and we're going to kind of
discuss like why that is like what's
going on there okay so
this is um this right here is your
example of like a basic uh funnel and
like where it sits and then let's get
into like kind of like what actually
um is going on in newsletter okay so
a newsletter is going to be
either weekly
or bi-weekly okay
um weekly is fine
you might be a little bit more
challenged to develop content for that
newsletter depending on what you're
going to do biweekly is also fine
anything after that there's going to be
a severe drop off in retention just
telling you from a lot of running a lot
of newsletters there's going to be a
drop off in in people being familiar
with you and buying your products so you
want to keep it weekly or bi-weekly i
think bowie glue is fine um for services
there are two main services that i use
to actually do newsletters so the first
one is mailchimp
mailchimp is really great it's very easy
i'd recommend it for any newsletter that
doesn't require a lot of graphics or a
lot of templating so if you're just
gonna send like a bullet point
newsletter or like text-based stuff
mailchimp is really good if you're gonna
do something a little bit more advanced
than that you can use a service called
constant contact which is more for um
advanced templates and things like that
the way that these services work is that
the number of users defines your price
so the more users you have the more um
it costs
but even if you have like a newsletter
of like 100 000 or more people like it's
gonna run you like 50 bucks a month on
mailchimp or something totally
negligible believe me
if you have that many users on an email
list and your open rates are like even
like 10
you are going to make that money back
really easily if you follow the rest of
this video
so
those are the two services i would use
uh i typically have a mail chimp just
going all the time
just just collecting emails or storing
emails and you can also it should also
export those into a csv and have those
emails available somewhere else here are
some of the newsletters that are the
most effective
and some of the ones that you can kind
of consider running and we'll go through
each one of them in turn so the first
one is educational so there should be
one large value proposition
per newsletter
um and i'm gonna give you some examples
of this a little bit later we're gonna
go through some of the um some some
newsletters just in my email that um i
subscribe to like hundreds of
newsletters just so i can get kind of
ideas and inspiration
for them um and then recommendational
this is actually my favorite i think
they're really good so this is like uh
the
this is uh five bullet friday
where every week tim ferriss who's an
influencer in the wellness space he
sends an email with like five things
that he either found were interesting or
he thought were like cool products
literally whatever he wants a video that
he thought he saw on youtube that he
thought was inspiring this is a great
model because it's really easy to design
for when you're doing something with
like education you have to come up with
that weekly so one of the things you
want to start thinking about when i'm
going through these types of newsletters
you want to start thinking about the
amount of work this is going to add to
whatever you're already starting to do
if you're running a business that's
product based and you need to add a
newsletter to it you're diverting into
content to retain your customers or to
get more product sales you need to
consider like if you do a weekly
newsletter that's highly educational
it's going to take a lot of time from
you so doing something like
recommendational or doing something um
in this these other fields it could take
less time might be more advisable right
um this sorry i'm gonna also update this
to types of newsletters that work i'm
gonna show you some that don't work in a
minute
so recommendational is great uh
particularly if you're an influencer
just hey here's five things that i found
that were interesting you are already
interesting to the people that are
following you so it's really easy so
imagine if i did newsletter it's like
five of the top marketing articles that
i read this week everybody would read
that newsletter right like that's that's
a very good newsletter to read so that's
an example of like well something you
could do in your expertise i think this
is probably the best type of newsletter
to run it's the easiest and it has a lot
of value to um to consumers okay the
next one is entertaining
which is uh you could do some kind of
like comedy or some kind of skits or
things like that i think this is
probably so i'm just putting this as a
one that works but i just i think it's
the worst one it takes the most amount
of time and it's the most amount of
creative energy and a newsletter works a
lot like a live stream in the sense that
like once a newsletter goes out it's
hard to reappropriate that content for
something useful you can do it you can
like resurrect it in the form of a video
or something later but typically once a
newsletter goes out like that content is
done that's that is also the people that
are consuming your content that are the
most core of your user base so those are
the people that are going to like see it
again somewhere else if you post it
somewhere else so you want to be careful
with like the entertaining one i'm just
putting it down there because it does
work many comedians have super
successful newsletters um and then the
last one that works is our second last
is covering news or recent news
in your genre
and then just to put this one down um
we'll put repurposing content or long
form
which i'll get to in a minute so
covering news is pretty obvious anything
that you might have happen in your area
if you're like a tech influencer or
you're a tech business covering like the
latest things that are happening in tech
and how they involve with you is a
pretty easy out for a pretty easy
newsletter if you are a business you
typically will not have a week's worth
of news every week so like for example
i don't have enough marketing stuff to
talk about every week but i do have
enough marketing stuff to talk about
like every two weeks um i could do a
news based article like pretty easily uh
somebody's like focusing like i noticed
this with a lot of like twitch
influencers there's just not enough
going on on twitch to talk about if
you're like a twitch meta guy um every
week so
like this is covering news and things
like that
are um not effective for them they want
to go for something more like
recommendation or educational
so uh for those that do have a lot of
news happening in their area it does
work and this could be really effective
um refurbishing long-form content just
means you take like an hour long video
maybe do some commentary on it and or or
some short form you see a lot of like
really influential marketers like gary
vaynerchuk or ramit setty do this they
just like repurpose long-form content
particularly off of podcasts or stuff
like that um if you have a long-form
piece of content where you're doing
something like two or three hours of
your business you're doing like a
podcast or something that's a really
easy way to do it
okay so here's some newsletters that
don't work
historically doesn't mean they can't
work just means they usually don't
personal or product updates
okay you see absolutely tons of these
hey guys here's what's going on with me
hey guys here's what's going on with our
product nobody cares nobody cares um
the other big thing is like uh along
these lines is like our huge sale emails
right
or like um
huge product discounts
again just nobody cares about this stuff
and what i want to do here is i'm going
to go through i'm going to screenshot
some of the titles
from the emails that i subscribe to just
to kind of give you an idea of um
which ones i think are very strong
particularly in the form of like so
these are like actual newsletters i'm
just scrolling off of my
uh my email right now
i'm just gonna copy and paste
and um we're going to keep in mind this
like
uh this right here
the notes that we're taking okay
okay so um
15 off don't miss out on postmates
is a pretty strong call to action this
is like one of those examples where
this is actually a good call to action
i don't like that it doesn't say what
you're doing
um
audible
typically they this they typically do
sales emails so like
um i want to just like put out some ones
that are like really really strong so
this one by living feel
why women need
vitamin d during pregnancy this is an s
to your email they're going for the
educational uh title and you can kind of
see inside the email i'll take a picture
for you
um that this is kind of like
like they're going for like some kind of
education
and evidence-based stuff so living feel
is a
kind of an athletic greens competitor
it's a smoothie you drink for health
food
that i've bought before and that i
actually really like
this is an example of like
a really high tier email that's that's
going to convert a lot because the super
educational open rates are going to be
insane
um
[Music]
these ones like the the hellofresh one
was the answer is always tacos
this is cute but i don't actually like
it for open rates
i'll see if there's some in here that i
really like
um
but you can see like most of these kind
of like fall
into the realm of like offers and
they're not educational but you
occasionally see one
that is actually quite good
and um
i like this one a lot one thing that 90
of ripped people do daily i would use a
little bit different wording here but
this is really good you could compare
this to um some of the other fitness
ones i have
which are like um i saw one down here
when i was looking through my notes here
we go
sunday roundup oldies but goodies by on
it
and then you see
the
the subtext of this is the best or arm
workouts for women they should have just
made their title the best arm workouts
for women that like because sunday
roundup i don't know whose roundup this
is i also don't care that it's a roundup
oldies but goodies i don't care about
any of this right i i know this video
this is from audit if i look over to the
left but i'm looking at this title first
to qualify if i want to see the email in
the context of a bazillion other things
if you just said the best art and
workouts for women you would target
every
woman on that list that wants to do arm
workouts and everybody's interested in
educating them on doing that right very
good title um missed opportunity here
compared to the other one okay so there
that's some of the stuff that like works
and doesn't work all right
um
let's uh let's talk about like how now
that you kind of like know that like
it's like how you're gonna set up your
newsletter
what's actually gonna happen
i think the general idea behind
newsletter conversion is the very
classic like gary vaynerchuk jab jab jab
right hook
so you're gonna do like four to five
newsletters
that are complete value
and you might have
a paragraph or a small
ending
note about a product you're launching
later
and so the way that i like to do
newsletters and the most effective that
i've ever been at them
is let's say that i am going to offer a
product like a merchandise drop
in two months
i might start
newsletters
a month and a half
mentioning that that winter sale is
going to come and it's going to be a big
deal
teasing product and stuff like that
that won't be the theme of the
newsletter right the like the theme of
the newsletter will be something
valuable it'll be one of the the five
things i i brought up before that's
gonna be the theme
the uh actual content will be good but
the end of the newsletter
might be something like
by the way winter sales coming here's
how to get involved okay and you want to
be building up
the kind of hype for that via the
newsletter so this also works great with
like courses or educational products or
any new products you're going to release
as a business this is absolutely how you
want to do it as a business you want to
ramp up that period of time to get
people interested as much as possible
and by the last newsletter and the
second
next newsletter you should have a date
and time where that that product
availability that product offering is
going to be available on your website
it's going to be go out to everybody
that merge drop is going to happen right
there needs to be a set date and time
that people on the newsletter can go and
they can um they can get your product or
whatever because i i think that if you
look at the reasons as to like why
you're doing a newsletter
number one
is big product releases
this is actually like the number one
reason to do it number two is keep an
engaged user base
and number three is basically selling
this info later
i think there are other ways to keep
engaged user bases with businesses
but if you are running a
low client
like like a low number of total clients
a newsletter is a better way to keep an
engaged user base than like traditional
content like youtube or or whatever so a
lot of businesses they i've talked about
this before a lot of businesses they
think that they need a social media
following so like okay if i'm x business
i i need um
i need to have a social media file if
you have 15 clients right like they
don't care if you have a twitter
or a youtube and you'd be surprised how
many companies have a full-time social
media person when they're like b2b and
they and they they like run
like they pay someone like 80 000 a year
to like maintain an account that like
nobody cares about you like if you're a
b2b person or or you're a consultant or
you're a person that has like a low
number of clients
then a newsletter is gonna do better
because it's gonna keep people more
engaged and that's gonna be like a more
detailed all those people are interested
in the same thing
so for those people they're going to
want to know like when something is
happening within your company
that is important and is like either a
major product release or something they
can like follow up on that's a
newsletter type of thing
for people that have a more extended
client base and are trying to attract
more clients top of funnel
and then they're eventually going to
like do a course and they're going to do
something else like that then like like
you know like like making some like
youtube content something that makes
more sense
for most businesses like local retailers
restaurants
um
any kind of like uh handyman type jobs
electrician
a plumber come to house type jobs things
like that service industry that's all
the newsletter stuff all that's
disappointing like making content
you know the guy the guy like five
states over five countries over from you
doesn't care about how to like
um
install something so that you can get
new clients unless you're doing that to
try to educate people on that
and then um keep everything so keeping
engaged user base just keep that all
that in mind like um you you can most
people opt to keep engaged user bases
through social media but i actually
think that a newsletter works better in
like over 50 of circumstances like where
you where they would have social media
accounts they should have newsletters
and that applies to some influencers as
well if you're a niche influencer
in a particular area and you're
educational
you should be you should have a
newsletter because people are going to
be more engaged uh the reason i don't is
because i just uh as as people know like
i don't have a newsletter for like what
i do here um although patreon kind of
does that um and my discord kind of
serves that purpose just because for me
personally like content creation is not
my full-time thing you know i want to
focus on my business i would have a
newsletter in a full-time position uh
you could also sell info later um
that that's well within your rights to
do once somebody signs up for um
for icann they agree basically that
you're going to be on the newsletter
west that's an important note by the way
i i should have brought at the very
beginning um you have to get people's
consent for them to sign up for a
newsletter that's federal law so there's
there's a walk on the icann law
which requires people to opt in in some
way to your newsletters that you can't
just
get people in right away they'll start
just sending a bunch of people uh emails
you're gonna get dinged uh it's gonna be
bad so make sure you have permission
some kind of sign up and then um i
believe that there's they need to also
confirm and verify their email address
by clicking a link going back it says
okay then they're on the list no problem
but just make sure you do that
once you do that you can probably sell
their info uh i'm pretty sure if you
wanted to um i don't like this option
i'm just putting it on there just
depending on the kind of business but um
that you know lots of people buy email
lists for very expensive you know fifty
thousand to a hundred thousand dollar
name email list that can go fifty
thousand to a hundred thousand person
list can go for anywhere between like
one dollar per user to fifty thousand
dollars to even like five ten dollars
per user just because it just depends on
what that niche is and what category
they're in
you know someone how cpms work
okay so did i leave anything out
um i don't think i did uh newsletters
overall are just a great way to get into
marketing um it's also a great way to
practice your writing and kind of
practice how to deliver value to people
newsletters challenge you to do
something consistently and and make it
valuable to people uh on a bi-weekly or
weekly basis um you can also always
start later start bi-weekly if you like
it and it works really well uh start
doing weeklies later you don't have to
start like super fast of a newsletter
every three days you know start slower
you can even do one a month right and
then you can always increase the tempo
and nobody's gonna complain about that
people will complain if you you pull it
back um yeah this is my objective to
like kind of talk through newsletters um
i think it's a really interesting form
of marketing a lot of people think that
newsletters are no longer effective but
um they are like the open rates are
still really good
you can craft them in such a way that
makes them very interesting to click on
and open and hopefully provide you some
examples of that and uh we could do some
more newsletter marketing type stuff
like specifically about how it works on
product sales and this kind of like an
overview of it and so for now that's it
thanks everybody for coming out and i
hope this was useful let me know bye
