hello today we are going to talk about
how to communicate more effectively both
in advertising and in general this is a
super important topic for anyone who
communicates at all and it is a topic
that was larger in scope than i
initially realized so i wanted to
prepare
some examples from the greatest
advertisements of all time about how to
effectively communicate and that's what
we're going to learn about starting with
the basic definition of communication
which might surprise you this is the
community the definition of
communication that i use in marketing
there might be another definition on
google or something but here's my
definition
effective communication is the meaning
of communication is what the other party
receives
or said another way the only purpose of
communication is what the person you're
communicating to
gets out of it
so if you haven't heard this definition
before this should start to change your
perspective right away on communication
it doesn't matter how eloquently you say
something it doesn't matter how verbose
you are it doesn't matter what big long
words you use to describe something it
doesn't even matter how fast or slow you
say something or your tone
all that matters is the
thing that gets received
the message the emotion the definition
the understanding that gets received by
the party you're trying to communicate
to now all the other things i just
mentioned are tools to get you there if
i use tonality that is more forceful and
more direct then you get a different
message than if i use a calm voice and i
speak in a way that has a slower
tonality you will get something
different from it
but that regardless the meaning of
communication is what the other party
receives if i use that direct intense
voice to give you
the the right thing that i wanted you to
receive
then i've succeeded so it doesn't matter
like what we focus on all the time is
these tools that are utilized for
communication instead of the actual
purpose of communication itself which is
to just get the message you want to
other people so how do you get the
message that you want to other people
well it starts by knowing your message
or put another way what do you want to
communicate or put an even better way
what is the outcome
of this communication
what do i want the other party to
receive
in terms of my conversation with them
in terms of the product they're buying
in terms of the service they're getting
in terms of the content they're
consuming
you should have a direct idea of the
outcome of the communication that you're
trying to espouse right so in every
single conversation and every single
sale and every single content create
your thing you're creating you should
have an idea of what the outcome is
maybe it's a simple thing so like my
outcome is to get you to buy this
product but but that's very different
than
like you'd be surprised that even
establishing that baseline
is something even more than a lot of
sales people do
because they start talking to you about
all these features and benefits and cool
things about the product that you might
not even care about if i want you to buy
a pro a product maybe the first question
i ask you if my outcome is to
communicate that this is the product to
buy is to ask you a question like what
kind of problems have you been
experiencing with x so if i'm selling
green tea how's your health lately how
are you feeling lately
do you feel like your health is where it
should be maybe they say no and i say
i've found a really crazy drink that is
super healthy it's super easy to make
it's cheap you can do it for less than
the price of coffee every day and it's
amazing made me change my life want me
to tell you about it right that's maybe
that's an intro maybe the outcome of my
content that i'm trying to
give to somebody
is i want them to understand how to
communicate better so i had a
super i mean this video is literally how
to communicate better but i understood
that going in i said okay i'm going to
explain as easy as possible how to
communicate better and i'm going to do
that by defining it i'm going to be
doing that by asking some critical
questions and by providing some
solutions and i wrote an outline that
was based on that and i'm going to
communicate that by showing some of the
ads and successful stuff that has
happened in the past
that is really well communicated and i
had that going in for every youtube
video i make and for every product i
launch at novo or at any other company
i've ever worked at i have a way of
communicating that i've decided on
beforehand and when i'm dealing with
things like relationships or problems or
um anything in life i am saying i i'm
constantly stepping back if i'm in a
meeting i'm constantly stepping back and
i'm saying what is the outcome of this
of this conversation what do i want this
person to do what do or or like it could
be anything it could be i want this
person to understand that i'm really
sorry i let them down about this event
or it could be and so that's going to
change the way that i communicate right
i'm not going to come in like a fireball
super angry i'm going to come in like
hey
all right maybe i just state that i'm
really sorry about event x and i feel
like i let you down can we talk about it
or is there any way we could fix this
maybe i'm disappointed in an employee's
progress for example something
completely different and maybe i s but
but maybe
i'm disappointed in an employee's
progress is different from the outcome
that i want right most people just say
i'm disappointed and they would go in
and so then what would they end up doing
well they end up slamming their employee
but my actual outcome is i want this
employee to get better at x so i'm going
to approach that conversation completely
differently than i would have initially
if i had just gone off of my emotions so
the first thing you want to do before
you start to communicate is you want to
step back and you want to think about
the outcome of your communication and
the problem is that people that are
failing at their products or services or
content are often inconsistent in the
messaging of their product services and
content creation they often don't
communicate correctly they're kind of
all over the place they don't keep their
videos or their product or their service
messaging on one theme the features and
benefits of their product or service
don't actually
um matter to anybody because they
haven't bothered to actually figure out
why they want to communicate this or if
there's a problem if you look at a lot
of the marketing advertising the
stuff that we research here um on this
channel
we talk a lot about these two
fundamental aspects of marketing right
it starts with a problem and then it
ends with communicating that you can
solve that problem so this is the second
part and we've done other videos about
how to find the problem
the other problem that people have so
let's just like start listing problems
so
smaller
failing businesses or content creators
are inconsistent in their messaging
on products
services or content what does
inconsistent mean it means um say
multiple
different
things or
saying things that people don't actually
care about
um notorious and content creation i see
this all the time where somebody makes a
video but just fails to ask why is this
interesting or makes a live stream ends
up live streaming for four years on
twitch or something and then
they um never ask themselves is this
actually interesting to anybody they end
up playing games and they sink you know
a thousand hours into something they
don't make a single dollar like this
happens all the time
failing to ask like is this interesting
to anybody or
just putting things out there that you
personally find interesting
instead of um
actually
actually um like
figuring out why it's interesting is
one of the first steps
to
why things fail right
um this is this definition is driving me
crazy okay so so
um
this is number reason number one reason
number two about why um cause your
credit is uh but it's not just that
content creators are inconsistent with
their messaging and and business or
inconsistencies with their messaging
it's also that
businesses
and content creators
think they are communicating x
but the meaning that their customer
is getting is why
so this was this one was actually the
inspiration for why we made this video
in mastermind chat on patreon we had
somebody come in
that could not understand why their
brand was not growing
and they were
advertising so that what they believe
they were doing
was they were on twitch
and they were talking about mental
health
um and they were like in trying to
improve people and bring mental health
into gaming so
like uh like self-improvement through
gaming
but when you actually go to their
channel they're just playing a game
they're just playing a game and there
was no indication
or like other than like maybe a small
info section that just uh like said that
that's what they're doing there was no
indication in the content itself if you
if you watched for like five minutes
that that was what was going on it's
just a person playing video games so
this is a classic example of a person
who thinks that they're communicating
something but the meaning that their
customer is actually getting is um
uh
something different completely and this
is often the result of delusional
thinking um not not in the sense of like
the psychology psychology dsm like crazy
delusion but just a person thinks
something is happening and something
different is happening and they
tend to people tend to convince
themselves through um confirmation bias
that they're doing the right thing and
they'll find reasons to justify that
rather than actually look at the market
because like the way to get out of this
level of thinking
is
look at the market results okay so how
many views are you getting from this how
many product sales are you getting from
this is the market responding to you if
the market is not responding to what
you're communicating um just like then
you're not succeeding in the exact same
way like a relationship right again this
doesn't just work just a business
standpoint if the the market in that
case is your girlfriend or your
boyfriend and if you're yelling at that
person why can't you understand this
and they are crying and they're like the
market's not responding to your results
you're not communicating what you think
you are right so you have to like you
have to step outside of yourself if you
have problem number number two
you have to step outside of yourself and
you have to say
okay what is the meaning of what i'm
actually trying to create what like so
like obviously something that i'm saying
here is not working and maybe you could
literally just say that like okay like
we're communicating on two different
paths something that i'm saying isn't
resonating or i'm failing taking
personal ownership good i'm failing to
convey this to you correctly
how like like what's the
misunderstanding here and start going
into more of an inquisitive mode the way
to solve number one is to solidify your
actual outcome statement what you
actually want to communicate and then
number two is to look at market feedback
right
so once you've established what your
actual outcome is and what you want to
communicate step number two is to look
at the feedback of that outcome did the
outcome actually work what do people
think and that will tell you what's
going on
those are the basics to how to
communicate effectively and then there
are two different solutions that i want
to provide that are
um
uh if
these two answers didn't work um i'm
just gonna provide two more ideas okay
so the first one is a line of thinking
called inverse questioning which is what
could i do
to absolutely communicate
this in the worst way possible
all right so if i were to make a video
about how to effectively communicate
what would be the worst way i could
possibly do that okay step number one i
would probably
um meander on for like 20 minutes about
a different subject in the beginning of
the video that had nothing to do with
communication
uh and then i would make sure that it
was as boring as possible so that most
people left by the time that i even
talked about communication if i ever did
it all uh if i wanted and then i would
create a bunch of [ __ ]
um
points that had no no solutions no
problems or no objective statements
and i would make it as vague and as
difficult to understand as possible um
and i would make it meander again go
through multiple different i'd probably
start telling stories about my personal
life um right right like you see what
i'm doing is like i can start to think
about how i could
absolutely butcher this video
and then i can think through that of how
to okay i should not do those things my
i should have a strong intro that
clearly states my objective that defines
the terms that provides problems and
solutions right so like you can start to
think through that through called the
inverse question inverse question works
all over the place you're gonna see us
do that a lot over the coming months
because i'm super into it right now and
then
of course the next solution is what is
my outcome what are the main points
listed simply
that i'm trying to communicate
so as simple as you can say it what are
you trying to say
right for the definition of what i gave
you for communication the meaning of
communication is what the other party
receives that's it we don't need to
explain anything else um
what is my youtube channel about i teach
marketing and advertising in new media i
teach marketing advertising on new media
platforms social media platforms that's
it that's all you need to know do i do
other stuff probably but i'm not going
to get into it how many times have you
asked somebody oh what's up what do you
do for work whatever and you've gotten a
10 page diatribe about um
all the bs that they do and like they're
like a pm at some company okay like they
could explain their job in like two
seconds but it's just like they've
either inflated themselves like they've
got problem number two where they think
they're communicating this highly
meaningful amazing job that they have
but they're actually communicating why
which is like this is super boring i
don't even care anymore what this person
does right what is novo do novo my
company we're an ad agency that connects
brands and influencers together to
create ads that's what we do but super
simple right
could i could i make that more
complicated yeah of course well we
designed creative campaigns to build out
special
um
uh it's so hard to do because i do the
opposite like so often i'm always like
trickling stuff down uh we we design
um complex and creative campaigns with
account managers
and with um and and with different
influencers across twitch youtube tik
tok instagram you know all the social
media platforms and then we build an ad
usually from the ground up we decide
what the ad is by targeting the specific
influencer and going through and
figuring out what their interests are
you know interests like fitness gaming
um lifestyle type stuff then we go try
to find brands you know for the brands
we look for just go on and on right but
or i could just say we're that agency
that connects brands and influencers
together and helps us make money make
ads right oh okay got it thanks
like one sentence you don't need to
provide all of that color detail if the
person is still interested they will ask
more questions right what is the purpose
of buddhism it is to end suffering
that's it right like like i could tell
you about the time the buddha meditated
under the body tree for 40 years and you
know he was like well it was it wasn't
40 years 40 days and you know he was
like wow this is really cool i figured
out
right like there's that that'll ask
questions though your customer will ask
questions if they are interested in
follow-up you only need to provide the
direct meaning of the communication that
they
ask for and
oftentimes people will almost always
people will respect you way more if you
actually do that versus if you expound
on it for a bazillion years and nobody
cares if you actually just say the thing
that they asked for and you do it as
succinctly and as properly as possible
they will ask more questions and they
will be impressed by your ability to
stop them yourself because so many
people talk on and on and on about
things
so these are the two solutions
in addition to what i gave you before
let us look at some successful ads that
have communicated something incredibly
well the first one i'm going to show you
is a diamond is forever i
love this ad
[Music]
there are two things in the world that
last longer than time
love
is one of them
a diamond is forever
amazing ad this ad changed the course of
culture by
picking up
five dollar rocks out of mines in africa
and making them worth thousands of
dollars
this ad in particular is unbelievable
because look at the messaging and the
communication that it sends
a couple that walks by two old people
that have stayed together the
implications they've stayed together the
entire time and meanwhile the overlay is
that love lasts forever and diamonds
also last forever and at the end you see
these two people holding hands this
young couple that's implied they're
going to become that old couple that's
why the woman's looking back in 20 on 20
seconds and
you can you can see that the implication
here is that that diamond is a symbol
for forever love which later beca this
could i just i get chills you can tell
i'm very passionate about advertising
this is such a good ad oh my god right
it literally changed the way that people
think
we have to
is engaging somebody who has to buy
a bazillion dollar overpriced thing
just to still convey this message and 40
years later we are now this is a this ad
was made in 1948 we are we are now just
in 2022 60 years later kind of being
like oh yeah you could kind of do a lab
grown diamond like that's fine but it's
still like a hallmark because of that
it's so amazing all right so de beers
what did they want to communicate they
said we want to communicate that
diamonds are the fundamental
thing of a successful long-term
relationship they're they're they're the
glue they're the binding effort and they
did that by saying a diamond is forever
and by making this advertising campaign
anything else here that i want to all
these are great um
i love this one too uh infamous
commercial where three old ladies are
looking at a um
and wendy's single has more beef than
the whopper or big mac and when did you
get more bean and less bun
so this is a 30 second it's actually 10
seconds that just communicates directly
exactly what they are saying so their
meaning of communication is we have more
actual beef we have more actual food
than all of our competitors
and they do it in like kind of a
hilarious and like awesome way and this
again was something that launched a like
every business had to compete with
wendy's after this and then wendy's had
another campaign about freshness after
the after they caught up on that wendy's
has been one of the only companies over
the course of the last like 40 years
that has just like historically smashed
marketing they are so good and they're
consistently good it's really amazing
for how long they've been around
so um you can see through this that the
the meaning of their communication and
wendy's single has more beef than the
whopper or big mac and when did you get
movie it's really simple at wendy's you
get more beef right like again they're
not using super uh complicated like um
like you know uh you know this is how we
make our beef we get it from these cows
and they're not telling any story that's
anything extra
other than
at wendy's you get more beef and the
lesson you should learn from this
is uh because the lesson from here
from the beers is if you communicate
correctly you can change people's
opinion completely the lesson from here
is that you don't have to be complicated
in doing it so when just we have more
beef than other people right and
oftentimes like people like what's the
benefit of your channel like why should
i watch you over marketing other
marketing advertisers nobody knows as
much as i do that that's it
right like there's just there's just
you're not going to find anybody else
that is able to
break down advertising and marketing
concepts better than me i'm going to do
it better than anybody else and then if
you do find that person i'll watch that
person and they'll figure out how to do
it better and i'll do it better like
that's why you watch me you don't watch
me because i'm an expert in
thermonuclear engineering or because i i
know which way the stock market's going
to go tomorrow you watch me because you
want to learn about what gets attention
you want to learn about the fascinating
fascinating psychology of how people
think about attention and i'm going to
tell you about it that's it right so um
what about apple i i like this too where
apple we don't need to watch the ad
because i'm just going to go off the
slogan think different
is an awesome way to say like hey we are
building a different product than other
people um the other one that i want to
show you which i don't have yet
is red bull
i think red bull is a phenomenal
advertising marketing communication
example
because
everything so first of all their slogan
red bull gives you wings is
a
and just an awesome way of saying you
get more energy from drinking this you
just you're just gonna be on top of your
game
and then they they power that statement
by all of these extreme sports
marketing things that they do
where famously people jump from space
people do base jumps people do crazy
biking stuff people do crazy
snowboarding stuff they sponsor tons of
these extreme events and the messaging
is that if you drink red bull you are
living life at the peak of experience
so this is an example of advertising or
messaging that
is
so powerful they don't need to tell you
exactly what it's about red bull gives
you wings if if you didn't understand
in like like if you were just if you're
like a like from some tribe
and you just said red bull gives you
wings you understood english and you
were like what like i don't i don't
understand what that is but
once you have the association with these
extreme sports events and the clever
advertising they do
where like somebody flies off
then you start to realize you make this
connection in your mind oh red bull
equals more energy equals more peak
experience equals more awesome life and
then that association gets you to drink
red bull because sure you want more
energy right and that is an example of
fantastic advertising so i wanted to
provide these three examples because
example number one is a culture changing
example de beers example number two is
like just saying the thing that you
communicate it's a lot of times one of
the best things you can do to
communicate an example number three is
that if you're communicating correctly
you don't even need to say the thing
directly you can just
create a feeling or an emotion in people
because again the meaning of
communication the purpose of
communication is what the person you're
communicating to gets out of it so you
are you do not have to
convey something
in any way except what they receive it's
so important to think about this and
uh the the when i use the example of
novo
uh and i gave you an example of what we
you know what we do we're an ad agency
that helps brands and influencers
connect together it actually took me a
really long time to distill novo down to
that sentence but i kept thinking about
it and i'll keep thinking about it and i
i believe that the majority of things
that can be communicated
can be done in
at least like the initial concept that
you want to communicate to someone could
be done in a very short manner of time
this might seem ironic from a person who
makes 30 to 50 minute videos but i'm
making deep dive
videos about
extremely content rich and dense
subjects
but even when i'm doing that i don't bs
a lot i talk a lot about the objective
stuff that is the kind of
soup that goes into the broth to make
the ramen right like like i i i talk
about it's just there's
there's two levels right there's the
cake and there's the ingredients and we
talk a lot about the ingredients here
but the cake is the cake i can just tell
you about the cake what is this a
vanilla cake but the ingredients we
might need to get more detailed there's
two ounces of this two two liters of
that whatever right right like
2ml of this vanilla extract or whatever
in the exact same way when you
communicate people are asking you a
question or they're being exposed to
your product for the first time or your
service or your content they want to
they want to know even if they don't
they'll say it they want to know
as fast as possible what's the problem
that you have or what's the problem that
i have and i'm trying to solve
and what are you trying to communicate
then once you get them into that you can
talk about the ingredients you can talk
about everything else okay
so that is an intro to how to
communicate effectively through
marketing um just
playing this video back in my head i
think this is a super important video
and i hope that you agree if you do
comment on it let me know um this one
might go to the main youtube channel if
you're watching this on the main youtube
channel this was originally a patreon
video so thank you very much for
supporting um me for watching this and i
appreciate it see you guys next time bye
