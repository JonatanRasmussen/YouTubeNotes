hello
i want to talk about something that is a
lot less grounded than what i normally
talk about but nonetheless extremely
important not only into business but to
lifestyle design and to success in
general
this is something that as an executive a
person who
creates and then executes on decisions
which is what i think an executive is
this is probably the most important
thing or concept that i think about so i
want to share that with you and that
concept is about creative mind and
creative space
but we're gonna see i think in the
course of this
video that my definition of creative
creativity as it applies to business and
lifestyle is a lot different from how we
might typically understand creativity
so let's talk about how we typically
understand creativity creativity might
be that if you have a piece of art that
you're working on and you want to draw
it
whatever kind of comes from your mind
allowing yourself to create that space
to paint that picture might be what
creativity is or creativity might be a
new idea or an innovation or an
invention it's typically the ways that
we think about creativity i think the
creativity is is different in the sense
of business and lifestyle design and i
would define creativity the following
way i think creativity equals an open
space
in which ideas that advance your life
or business
can appear
so this is a really different definition
of creativity it's a really different
definition of being creative
it means that an open space in which
ideas that advance your life and
business can appear means that we have
to actively cultivate a mindset
at least once a week or even once a day
if you can manage it
to be able to allow ideas
and
lifestyle design to propagate
and and that's also suggested infers
that it won't do it on its own but
meaning that um if you tie yourself up
with a bunch of stuff
and you do you you classically do the
e-myth which is you work in your
business not on your business
then you will lose the most important
aspect
of
the power of your mind and your brain to
be able to unlock
the real things that will actually
advance you and make you successful okay
so i know i'm sounding like a like a
crazy yoga person right now so let me
kind of like
ground this a little bit
so
there's a space in your mind
that gets
left open
for
new ideas and new concepts and new
things whether it be video and content
ideas whether it be ideas that will
advance your business whether it be
things you just know that you need to do
that will push the needle in the right
direction for you to succeed
but this and maybe you know the space
maybe you don't if you know about this
space and you'll know that like
sometimes in the shower you'll have a
great idea or sometimes in bed you'll
have a great idea
and if you go look at when you're having
these great ideas you'll notice that all
of these ideas that you have are when
you are not doing something else you're
not on your phone you're not on social
media you're not playing a game you're
not talking on the phone you're not in a
business meeting you are probably
sitting alone in one of the rare
instances that we have left
to
cultivate ideas and that is because
for something to exist somewhere it
needs a space to put it in okay so like
if i want this pen to exist it has to
have a place right if it doesn't have a
place it can't be anywhere and if it
can't be anywhere then it isn't anywhere
okay and and just like that works for
physical objects right if you have a
room that's too small to fit a desk in
you can't fit a desk in it that it has
to have room it has to have space for
that desk to exist in exactly the same
way ideas have to have space to exist
but everything that we have started to
do with media phone
everything social media
um getting distracted or just like
working on that doesn't matter
we have limit we've basically
put our mind in a very small room where
we're being fed the information that we
um that we that we get and we aren't
giving
we aren't creating a room where these
ideas can flow so the vast majority of
people
in today's age are considered not
creative right creativity is a rare
skill set and people pay a lot of money
for it one of the reasons why the united
states and uh and other first world
western countries lead the lead the way
in terms of high salaries is because
lots of height high-powered jobs are
looking for creativity uh in their
management and executive positions now
um
there are now as com countries are
developing in the east we're starting to
see that same thing happen where
creativity is this really valued type of
thing
um
but it's rare it's hard to be creative
it's very very difficult to do
and so i want to talk about that process
now that we've defined it so
creativity means that you are actively
creating space in your life to allow
ideas to flow and then you're not
stopping that process so um i think that
the way this looks
and i'll tell a story
which i've told before
that when i ran a company called counter
watching gaming
the most useful time that i had i
probably ended up working like i mean
legit like probably 80 or 90 hours a
week because and a lot of people say
they work 80 or 90 hours a week but they
don't really i i think i've almost never
met anybody that has actually worked
that hard and i did work that hard for
about two years because weekends were
also events right so we had tournaments
over with the weekends and then mondays
through friday was the regular business
hours and everything we had to do i
would typically work about seven a.m to
two
after um i went to yoga and uh 2 a.m was
about when everybody went to sleep i get
like catch like four or five hours of
sleep and then i'd wake up again and
that was like monday through sunday two
years and that exhausted me so much i
had to take eight months off of doing
absolutely anything in my life and
to something that i still haven't
recovered um
so so any anyway a little bit of a rant
with people
that always drive me crazy when they say
they work that hard because i think the
the actual cost is so high
the most useful amount of
time that i spent was actually about an
hour or two a week when i went to a
small tea shop
and i gave them my phone and i sat down
with a paperback journal
and i
did uh this basically uh
i had no media no phone or no influence
whatsoever
um i had a paperback journal and then i
just asked myself what is the number one
problem in my company right now what's
the number one problem in my life right
now i used the 80 20 template that i
have shown in a previous video that i
think is on this patreon pretty sure it
is it's also in questions millionaires
ask themselves publicly on my youtube
channel so you can go back and look at
those questions and then i would write
out the answers physically and the more
time that i have spent trying to create
creative open space
the more important i've realized it is
and it's a little bit frustrating
because i don't think i can tell you how
important this process is unless you try
it so the first thing i would recommend
is that you should find a way that in
that the first hour of your day involves
absolutely zero media or phone usage uh
if if at all possible uh and that also
and really it doesn't involve any kind
of input whatsoever so that uh i used to
think that like well i could write i
could wake up and i'd have like maybe a
healthy habit like reading or something
but i i've realized that when you wake
up
you need to train your mind to be in a
place to accept new ideas and to um be
ready to tackle things um that you that
you're going to be doing and and to do
that
ever sometimes like if i
wake up
and then
i
read like something on social media i
i've i've noticed just by being really
introspective that i could be 20 to 40
percent less effective than i would be
if i didn't do that but if i take an
hour to just take a shower work out
my first hour no media no influence
whatsoever and just let my mind sit on
autopilot and not try to force anything
that like the ideas and the creativity
that come from that are are always
life-changing things that advance my
business or my life in some way that
make me decide to go pursue a hobby that
i needed to pursue that um
indicate to me there's some direction in
my business that i should change it's
really really important to do this
and if you can't
do this
when you wake up
you need to cultivate it
in the time that you have by taking an
afternoon or
some type of time as much as you can to
um
sit
and write out this process and just let
those ideas
come and this is something that like
writers and executives are very familiar
with
every executive that i've interviewed or
or mentored under has had some uh
exact process of doing this where they
remove all other influence and they sit
and they think about ideas particularly
they kind of think about
what is the thing that i really need to
do that i'm ignoring that like would
move me forward like what's the one hour
a day that i can spend to really move
myself forward because i i think you can
build a multi multi-million dollar
enterprise on a few hours a day i really
do believe that i think if you want to
become like tesla and you want to become
like a billionaire i think that requires
the kind of chewing glass that elon musk
talks about where you literally
sacrifice all else but i i i also truly
believe that nobody listening to this
video needs to be that person
or have that level of uh impact i i
certainly don't like need to be like a
multi-billionaire but i believe you can
build you certainly can build like 150k
200k a year
self-generating business that supports
you
beyond like your wildest dreams
on a few hours a day because tools and
automation
have gotten to the point where that's
possible
but
you can only do so if you create the
open space that i'm talking about
because otherwise your time will not be
spent
on
effective things okay like you'll be
so wrapped up in like the efficiency
that maybe you spend three to four hours
writing emails for example and you think
you've gotten a lot done but you've
never converted on anything
one of the um things i i think about a
lot in relationship this is conventions
this was on my mind recently conventions
are
um like like twitchcon or like pax or
whatever right a bunch of people show up
uh go to the convention and they feel
like they're getting work done but i i i
went back through all the conventions
that i ever did
and i thought about the actual dollars
per hour value that i gained from those
and it was very little to none maybe one
or two deals uh total
and that is like approaching conventions
with intention like i've i went i
listened to people talk about how to be
effective at conventions i i openly
networked um but it just doesn't produce
those results like it's just not a a
open space where those kind of results
happen those results happen by you
saying okay
um this
actually joe rogan describes this really
well it's like a video game problem you
know how you're on a level in a video
game and you can go right or left and
sometimes you just make a mistake and
you can say and you go left and that's
the wrong way and you got to double back
and you got to go the other way it's up
to you to make the decision to say no i
think this is a right turn this is this
is this is this problem right and you
have to have the creative space to be
able to make those decisions and you
have to know that you you need the
creative space to make decisions you
have to know those decisions are there
because those decisions are actually
worth being made right now there's three
five
one ten things that you need to do in
your business or your life to change it
in a way that would be enormously
positive in 10x and 100 extra results
but you
will never even encounter or know those
things if you're so wrapped up in all of
the and you don't allow
yourself to step back and create
this space uh
in order to do this so so
you you have problems right now that you
don't even know you have right that that
are not being addressed and there's
something that you could do
to 5 or 10x your revenue or your
follower account or your your product
sales right now like there's something
you could do
what but the activity of actively
creative creating creative space and and
sitting in creative mind as much as
possible will start to unlock those
pathways and and start to
um you you'll start to see
those places open up
when when they didn't before
once you kind of step
back
um
from the problem
there is a
great
quote from a zen master which is
be in the world
but don't be of it
which means
in the exact same way you you exist
as a within your business within your
lifestyle within the design of your life
but you are not like attached you know
you know of those results
tied into the daily process
of of trying to control and make things
happen
your best ideas
and what you need to do will come from
surrendering to a creative space
and the reason why
this is such a rare skill is because
most people listening to this will think
i'm crazy uh and
very few people will take the time to
realize this is a trainable skill that
every
every executive
will tell you they have you you can go
to any executive at a high-powered
company that's making decisions and ask
them about this like open creative space
and they will they will they'll word it
differently than i'm worried it but the
because this space doesn't really have a
form
and it is something that you just have
to trust is there it's really weird
because like i y
you can
sit down and you i can just close my
eyes and i can
put the general idea that i'm going to
think about things that are going to
afford my business and then i just let
go sit back and totally surrender to
that process and keep a notepad beside
me and 90 of the time i will come up
with something that is life-changing or
amazing for novo or from my content
direction all of the
content direction changes that i've made
um
have all been in this context they've
all formed in this context and every
major idea that i've had that has
advanced my life in a substantial way or
decision that i've made has come from
that place
um and and you'll see like if you talk
to
really famous writers for example
they will tell you
that
the work that they are doing almost
doesn't feel like it's theirs and i i
can report the same thing where i feel
like a lot of times i'll get an idea for
something and it just doesn't even feel
like it's coming for me it feels like
it's coming from that open space
but um
i even even in my life i need to do more
work to
open up that space so that's why
you can work
physically work like two or three hours
a day
and
then the space around your work
creates
the effective makes those two to three
hours effective so the yoga you do that
opens up your mind and body and makes
you more relaxed and makes you more open
to things the meditation you do the
hobbies you pursue the exercise that you
do the nutrition right the way everybody
talks about these things as important
but doesn't really tell you why and i'm
telling you the reason why is because it
creates space to be able to do
these
to to make that time effective because
for so many people that time is not
effective and is basically
worthless
okay
so
i um just want to share this with you
and um
talk to you about like this creative
space and encourage you to take like
even an hour a week to
totally surrender all your media devices
and just sit in space
and see what comes up and if this works
for you uh let me know it would be
really cool because i i've seen it work
for a lot of people and uh i i know this
is a little bit weird but i think if you
you you kind of like
suspend the disbelief a little bit and
then sort of let this thing happen
it could be uh pretty amazing for you
and and really produce some
extraordinary results i hope this helps
talk to you soon
