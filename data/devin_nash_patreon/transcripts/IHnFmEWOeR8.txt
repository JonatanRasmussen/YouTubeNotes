Hyper Light Drifter, a 2D action role-playing
game, is the result of Alx Preston’s unwavering
motivation caused by his congenital heart
disease.
Congenital heart disease is a general term
for a range of heart defects that develop
during pregnancy or birth.
While some individuals, post-surgery, lead
relatively normal lives, others require ongoing
care and medical attention.
In Alx’s case, his heart had multiple holes
that needed to be patched up during an open
heart surgery when he was only about one year
old.
Although the surgery saved his life, it left
him with severe digestive and immune system
issues, resulting in multiple hospitalizations,
some of which were near-fatal.
To stay alive, Alx had to have a pacemaker
and heart valve installed.
He takes over a dozen pills daily to maintain
his health and has to stick to a very strict
diet.
Additionally, he sees two cardiologists every
six months: one for regular checkups and another
specializing in monitoring his cholesterol
and pacemaker.
On top of that, Alx has been diagnosed with
a genetic mutation that causes numerous other
health issues.
It's hardly surprising that he often struggles
to not feel like “horrible garbage” on
a daily basis.
Despite these obstacles, he co-created a highly
successful video game franchise, which is
even being adapted into a TV series.
“I think I have an unnatural amount of motivation
and I think a lot of that stuff stems from
the fact that ‘eh, I could die at any moment.’
Who knows how long I’m really going to live.
I didn’t even think I’d make it past 30.”
Alx's condition has always limited the types
of physical activities he can engage in, which
led him to spend a lot of time playing video
games and immersing himself in various other
media.
These activities, especially video games,
offer an escape to entirely different worlds
where he can temporarily set aside his worries
and push the boundaries of his imagination.
Bits and pieces of Hyper Light Drifter have
been swirling around in Alx's mind since his
childhood, but it wasn't until his college
years that he began to express these ideas
artistically.
He began painting and experimenting with film
and animation.
Initially, he created a lot of work that he
describes as 'unsatisfying, straight-up bad,'
but he believes that’s what most art students
are supposed to do.
The process of throwing a lot of stuff on
the walls to see what sticks, what resonates
with oneself and peers, is essential.
For Alx, this was a valuable experience, not
only to hone his artistic skills but also
to help him define what he actually wanted
to say with his work moving forward.
After college, he worked on commercials for
a while as an illustrator and storyboard artist.
This period was instrumental in teaching him
about pitching projects and effectively communicating
a clear message.
Eventually, he started going to a monthly
game jam called Strawberry Jam, hosted in
coffee shops.
Here, various media creators would gather
to mingle and make inspiring indie games,
purely for the joy of it.
In early 2012, Alx was hospitalized again
and it was an exceptionally difficult period.
He only weighed 90 lbs, was mostly bedridden
and unable to eat anything but prefabricated
medical goop through a tube punched in his
stomach.
This true waking nightmare did spark a realization:
he needed to share his creativity with the
world.
Previously, he had been very private about
his art, sharing it only with close friends
and family.
But Alx grew tired of keeping his work to
himself and allowing his health issues to
hold him back.
No matter what would happen from now on, he
was going to push forward and create the video
game he’s been envisioning since childhood.
To start things off, Alx drew loose sketches,
developed rough ideas, and experimented with
a number of game engines.
Video games such as 'Mega Man Zero,' 'Zelda:
A Link to the Past,' and the 'Souls' series
greatly inspired Alx.
Some critical elements in those games informed
a lot of decisions for Hyper Light Drifter’s
design and atmosphere building.
However, 'Super Metroid' was the first experience
of almost pure visual storytelling that captured
his attention and ended up being deeply inspiring.
He loved the mystery, the sense of discovery,
the feeling of being alone in an alien world,
and its incredible atmosphere and tone.
In terms of animation, Studio Ghibli films
demonstrated to him how beautiful animation
and design can bring a world to life.
Arguably, Alx's biggest source of inspiration
has been his medical condition.
It provides him with a unique perspective
on life, a perspective that directly influences
'Hyper Light Drifter' and its narrative.
“I have a deep need to keep funneling my
personal nightmares and frustrations into
my work.
It keeps me functioning.
I don’t think I can avoid it.”
The main character, known simply as The Drifter,
suffers from a deadly illness for which he
is desperately seeking a cure, a theme Alx
is intimately familiar with.
He decided to make a 2D single-player action
RPG with a pixel art aesthetic.
During this time, the group from the monthly
game jam grew tired of the limited power outlets
and unreliable Wi-Fi in the coffee shops.
This led to discussions about renting a space
for hosting game jams and other artistic events.
Consequently, Glitch City was founded as a
community space for indie developers.
Initially operating out of Alx's garage, the
venture quickly evolved.
By early 2013, they had pooled their resources
to rent a coworking space, with the aim of
fostering indie game development.
Before we move on, I’d like to talk about

Now back to the video.
It’s through Glitch City that Alx met programmer
Beau Blyth.
Alx quickly noticed Beau’s genius and invited
him to join Hyper Light Drifter’s development.
They co-founded Heart Machine, a name inspired
by the machines that have been vital in keeping
Alx’s heart alive.
Working as a duo, they were able to generate
more ideas and insights, accelerating the
game’s development.
They chose the GameMaker engine for two main
reasons: Beau's extensive experience with
it from projects like 'Samurai Gunn,' and
its suitability for creating 2D games.
A few months into development, they prepared
a Kickstarter campaign to raise funds needed
to fully realize their vision for Hyper Light
Drifter.
After working out the core mechanics, creating
graphics for various characters and levels,
composing a sample soundtrack, and preparing
a trailer, the duo felt ready to unveil the
project to the public.
Alx estimated that $27,000 would be sufficient
to cover three key aspects.
First, it would allow them to fairly compensate
Beau and Rich Vreeland, also known as Disasterpeace,
who had agreed to compose the soundtrack.
Second, establish Heart Machine as a real
game development studio, which takes a fair
chunk of money and time.
Third, it would fund the hiring of playtesters
and the incorporation of community feedback
to refine the game.
Originally, they aimed to release the game
by mid-2014.
However, these plans changed after the project
evolved into a highly successful Kickstarter
campaign.
The Kickstarter launched in September 2013.
Remarkably, in less than 24 hours, it not
only reached the $27,000 goal but also exceeded
$40,000.
Things weren’t slowing down either, and
within days, the campaign had raised over
$100,000.
A key factor in its rapid popularity was the
team's involvement with Glitch City and the
larger indie game community.
This connection provided easier access to
the press, ensuring that news about the Kickstarter
spread quickly.
While Alx was immensely grateful for all the
support, the 30 days of the Kickstarter campaign
turned out to be some of the busiest of his
life.
He quickly had to think of new stretch goals
as the campaign surpassed the original ones
within just a few days.
Furthermore, after his daily work on 'Hyper
Light Drifter,' he dedicated many hours to
fostering and maintaining relationships with
fans and backers.
He provided daily updates on the game’s
development throughout the duration of the
Kickstarter and responded to lots of incoming
messages.
As it became apparent that they would receive
significantly more funding than initially
asked for, the scope and vision for 'Hyper
Light Drifter' began to expand.
To support this larger vision, additional
developers joined the team.
Thanks to the network at Glitch City, it wasn’t
difficult to find reliable partners.
Teddy Diefenbach, a co-founder of Glitch City,
joined the team as a programmer and designer,
even though Teddy was initially focused on
developing their own game.
Teddy needed some additional income to sustain
themselves for a few months so they could
work out the kinks of their own crowdfunding
campaign.
Therefore, on the day the 'Hyper Light Drifter'
Kickstarter launched, Teddy reached out to
everyone at Glitch City inquiring about any
short-term gigs.
By the time Alx responded, the Kickstarter
had already gained significant momentum, leading
Alx to propose that Teddy join Heart Machine.
Although Teddy had envisioned creating a very
different type of action RPG, the temptation
of contributing to the captivating world and
characters that Alx and Beau had started developing
was too compelling to resist.
Casey Hunt, a long time friend of Alx joined
during the Kickstarter as well and he became
the cornerstone of conversations about design,
story and everything else.
Casey's skills in concepting, world building
and his carefully considered approach to design
all contributed to shape the game in many
ways.
As mentioned earlier, Richard Vreeland, also
joined the team to compose the soundtrack.
Having previously scored 'Fez', Alx felt lucky
to have him onboard for Hyper Light Drifter.
Once Alx was done assembling the team, the
studio counted five full-time employees.
To celebrate the conclusion of the campaign,
they organized a livestream on the last day,
where the entire team discussed their future
plans.
It was the perfect activity to start building
their relationship as a team.
These five developers, along with some contract
workers, would spend the next couple of years
figuring out what a drastically expanded version
of Hyper Light Drifter would look and play
like.
Naturally, this meant that they would not
meet the original deadline of June 2014.
After the 30-day campaign, Heart Machine had
raised over $645,000.
Although that may sound like a lot, Heart
Machine still had to stretch every single
dollar.
After accounting for Kickstarter's 5% fee,
Amazon Pay’s 3% cut, and cancellations due
to banking issues, the studio was left with
approximately $584,000.
To maximize these funds, they minimized overhead
costs as much as possible.
Being part of Glitch City, where they shared
office space with other indie developers,
significantly helped to reduce expenses.
Regarding salaries, Alx proposed to every
team member the option of accepting a lower
wage in exchange for a more favorable revenue
share.
Most agreed to this, resulting in a modest
salary with the potential for substantial
bonuses in the future.
Heart Machine also allocated a portion of
their budget for events like PAX.
While these events are crucial for generating
excitement, gaining press coverage, engaging
with fans, and maintaining team morale, they
can be quite expensive.
Setting up a full booth and sending several
team members to manage it and interact with
visitors can easily exceed $10,000.
Additionally, to keep the team motivated and
provide a fun atmosphere, the studio maintained
a budget for celebrating milestones.
Activities such as go-karting, team dinners,
and similar events provided a welcome break
and helped keep the team motivated and connected.
Glitch City proved to be an ideal workplace
for Heart Machine.
As Alx put it, “We can ask for advice from
one another, ask for play testing, thoughts,
and have long conversations about detailed
design topics.
But because it’s not a conventional office
environment, it’s also possible to just
not turn up when solitude is needed.
Sometimes you want to hide in a dark cave
alone and work, shut everyone else out.
There are ups and downs, like any situation.”
During the Kickstarter campaign, the studio
received multiple offers from publishers.
However, they chose not to work with any of
them.
The funds raised through Kickstarter allowed
the team to stay independent and retain full
creative control.
This independence, on the other hand, came
with more responsibility and pressure to set
and meet their own milestones.
The games event circuit provided an excellent
framework for this, ensuring that they met
specific deadlines and had important playable
segments ready for the public to test.
About a month after the Kickstarter, the team
faced its first internal milestone: presenting
a public demo at MineCon in Orlando.
The event organizers had invited Alx and his
team, and they saw it as an excellent opportunity
to showcase their first public demo and gather
valuable playtesting data.
However, most of the developers were still
exhausted from the Kickstarter so Teddy decided
to fly out there by themselves.
On the night before the event, Teddy was still
assembling a level in their hotel room, working
until three or four in the morning.
Teddy then reached out to Alx, who was on
the West Coast where it was around midnight,
to request if he could add graphics.
By the next morning, Alx had transformed Teddy’s
rudimentary level into a visually stunning
first demo of Hyper Light Drifter.
Teddy remembers feeling they made the right
choice to join Heart Machine.
The success of their Kickstarter caught the
attention of YoYo Games, the creators of the
GameMaker engine.
As a result, they offered Heart Machine their
direct support during the game's development.
This support proved invaluable, as it allowed
the developers to report priority bugs.
Their intensive use of the engine, combined
with constantly pushing it to its limits,
led them to discover issues that had previously
gone unnoticed.
In the early stages of development, Heart
Machine utilized GameMaker's standard tile-based
room editor.
Alx would create giant Photoshop files filled
with art, and Teddy would then make these
designs playable.
However, this workflow had some glaring weaknesses
that limited the world’s potential.
The studio didn’t want the world to look
and feel tile-based.
It needed to feel natural, unique and lived-in.
When looking at early prototypes, noticeable
patterns emerged, with recognizable shapes
that the team wanted to avoid.
Furthermore, Alx's art was so strikingly beautiful
that any compromise which might sacrifice
even a single pixel was unacceptable.
Object and enemy scripting was also very difficult
and tedious to implement.
As a temporary measure, the developers just
threw a bunch of enemies all over the place
to try and make combat interesting.
Anything more creative would require an outside-the-box
solution.
Initially, YoYo Games offered to add features
to address these issues, but the team chose
to tackle them on their own.
Their first approach involved using an exporter
that integrated Photoshop files, aiming to
streamline the pipeline workflow, as well
as facilitate more creative enemy scripting.
The second iteration of prototypes featured
more organic shapes, giving levels more of
a ruined and crumbled look.
The enemies’ behavior was also refined,
eliminating the need for players to fight
large numbers at once.
However, other issues persisted, especially
with GameMaker’s room editor.
Adjusting objects or the layout of a level
required frequent re-exports, and programmers
had to manually update elements like hitboxes.
It was at that point that the devs decided
to create their own editor.
Beau came up with an outside-the-box idea
for a custom editor, which Teddy initially
shot down.
That said, Beau went ahead and gave it a shot
anyway.
To boil it down, the idea was to build an
editor within the game itself.
Unable to extend GameMaker to add their own
tools and menus, they opted to implement everything
they needed directly into the game environment,
where they had complete control.
When Beau had a prototype of the editor ready,
the developers could simply click play and
begin building the world in-game.
It featured a sketch tool that greatly simplified
the process of adding terrain.
Developers could even select specific layers
to work on.
Interestingly, they used the shadows layer
as a space to leave notes for themselves,
since that layer wouldn’t need final touches
until the very end of development.
The editor also included an object system
that made it possible to easily place Alx’s
Photoshop assets onto the terrain.
Certain objects even had multiple variations
that could be randomized while placing them
in the game.
Furthermore, the editor's link system simplified
the process of connecting objects to other
elements and triggering events.
Beau ensured that each object had accurate
collision detection, which streamlined the
entire process.
These features were just a few of the many
capabilities provided by the custom editor.
The team could immediately begin playtesting
their creations by simply placing The Drifter
into the scene.
Remarkably, they continued to add features
to the editor up until one month before the
game's release.
Alongside Photoshop and GameMaker, the team
also utilized Pro Motion for animations and
software like Premiere, After Effects, and
Flash.
Heart Machine made the interesting decision
to include no text in their game.
From the start of development, Alx and Beau
were considering using minimal text and dialogue.
They made some prototypes that included numbers,
but barely featured any words.
However, it wasn't until their Kickstarter
campaign that the full team committed to creating
a game completely devoid of numbers and words.
“I think we all wanted to try something
a bit different when it came to storytelling.
It was a huge challenge, but crafting an experience
told entirely through the visuals and the
audio was something we agreed early on was
a worthwhile endeavor to set us apart and
focus on the more impactful moments and components.”
Alx's background in animation and visual storytelling
became essential in this ambitious endeavor
to keep the game focused on the imagery and
the environment.
Needless to say, this approach led to a lot
of interesting yet frustrating design problems.
Despite their efforts, in rare instances,
they found it necessary to compromise and
include some text.
For instance, the game displays text in the
first ten minutes for tutorial purposes.
The developers wanted to make absolutely sure
that every player understood basic mechanics
like healing, which would have been hard to
convey through level design alone.
Teddy mentioned that while it most likely
would have been possible to avoid text during
the tutorial, it would have required significantly
more time to develop and implement the right
ideas.
Text is also present in the pause menu and
credits.
The team rationalized these instances by categorizing
them as non-diegetic elements: visible to
the player but doesn’t exist within the
game's world or is acknowledged by its characters.
The only instance where text appears within
the game world itself is on mysterious pillars.
These were added to provide some lore and
give the game more depth.
However, the text on these pillars is not
in a real language and doesn't relate to the
main objectives of the game.
Having close to no text in the game led to
an extensive iterative process, especially
for designing the game's shops in terms of
functionality and appearance.
An easier yet still complex example is the
sword upgrades.
The devs agreed putting a picture of a sword
on the building’s sign was enough to communicate
that this is the sword upgrade shop.
Inside, the player encounters an NPC holding
a sword, with additional swords displayed
on the wall, reinforcing the shop's purpose.
Once you interact with the NPC, the player
sees an image of themselves holding a sword,
accompanied by a sword icon.
While this may seem excessive, Heart Machine
was determined to ensure that every player
unmistakably understood where they were and
what they were doing.
After all, in Hyper Light Drifter, in-game
currency is scarce, making each purchase a
significant decision for players.
If a player regrets a purchase, that’s on
the developers and Heart Machine took this
very seriously.
Therefore, they spend a lot of time and effort
figuring out ways to clearly demonstrate each
upgrade's function and the consequences of
buying it.
At first, the team considered implementing
a test ground for trying out upgrades.
However, this raised the challenge of communicating
to players that they were merely testing the
upgrades, not purchasing them.
According to Teddy, this approach raised more
questions than it answered.
Ultimately, the team decided to attach an
animation to each upgrade to illustrate its
effect.
To familiarize players with the shop's UI
layout even before they encounter it, the
studio designed it to mirror the inventory
menu.
They employed the same assets and underlying
code, with only minor adjustments.
A particularly tricky problem was indicating
the cost of an item without using numbers.
The team's solution was to display the price
as golden squares next to the upgrade.
These squares also appear in the player's
money box, which flashes to show the corresponding
amount of money.
Another issue was conveying to players that
they lacked sufficient funds.
The final iteration there was to have the
squares flash red and accompany this visual
cue with a sound effect.
Although this solution may seem straightforward,
it took many iterations to make it feel natural.
Heart Machine also had to get creative when
it came to communicating the game’s larger
goals and underlying questions: What is the
player's purpose in the game?
Why are they here?
What are their objectives?
Where should they go?
These questions are largely addressed during
the opening cutscene, where the developers
emphasize certain visual elements through
repetition — a dog, diamond-shaped objects,
four pillars, four towers, and so on.
The cutscene depicts a diamond splitting into
four pieces, with the Drifter attempting to
grab it.
Following this, the player finds themselves
in the Drifter’s apartment.
Here, the developers almost lose control over
the player, but not before presenting a diagram
summarizing how to beat the game.
Interestingly, the team reinforced the diamond
shapes to such an extent that they eventually
had to redesign many items to prevent them
from resembling diamonds; only the main goals
and objects were allowed to be associated
with diamonds.
Hyper Light Drifter’s narrative unfolds
primarily through visual storytelling, as
traditional dialogue wasn't an option.
The game features sprawling levels filled
with dead bodies and ruins, intriguing NPCs
and hidden areas, all designed to keep the
player engaged and curious.
While making the soundtrack, Rich was heavily
influenced by composers like Claude Debussy
and Maurice Ravel.
He likes to use synth sounds, dedicating a
lot of time to shaping them to inject them
with a sense of movement and make them feel
alive.
His work on FEZ marked the beginning of his
journey to make synth sounds more expressive,
a theme he continued to explore in Hyper Light
Drifter.
Rich employed techniques like reverb, distortion,
noise addition and tape saturation to give
warmth and texture to the score.
Significant attention was given to how sounds
are spatialized in the stereo field, ensuring
everything has ample room to breath.
Drawing inspiration from sources beyond music,
he read Hayao Miyazaki's manga adaption of
'Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind' towards
the end of the project, which helped him maintain
momentum and complete the score.
Heart Machine initially planned to release
the game on five different platforms simultaneously.
However, they reconsidered this strategy after
receiving advice from other indie studios,
like Supergiant Games, advising against it.
Instead, they chose to launch the game only
on PC, Mac, and Linux.
After multiple delays, the team eventually
set a firm deadline for March 2016.
It was a terrifying prospect, especially in
light of Alx’s scheduled heart valve replacement
in November 2015, which would inevitably leave
him unable to work for some time.
The team began playtesting a rough version
of the entire game in late 2015 with family,
friends, and fellow developers.
Subsequently, they also conducted a comprehensive
QA series with random playtesters just a few
months prior to the release.
On the night before the official release,
everything that could go wrong did go wrong
for Heart Machine.
They had issues with their Steam keys, specifically
those meant for Kickstarter backers.
Additionally, internet problems made it difficult
to manage the game's launch on Steam.
At midnight on March 31st, the internet began
freaking out and asking why the game’s not
live yet.
It wasn't until four or five in the morning
that they were finally able to launch the
game.
The release was met with highly favorable
reviews from both critics and gamers.
Hardcore Gamer praised the game in their review,
stating, “Alx Preston and his team have
delivered a title that highlights everything
great about the medium as a whole, it’s
as simple as that.”
Alx had accomplished his goal of sharing his
creativity with the world.
"The support of the community, the rapid response
from everyone, the overwhelmingly positive
feedback has all brought me back from the
brink of a very difficult time in my life.”
Hyper Light Drifter’s release was a significant
stress relief for Alx Preston and the rest
of the team, but they didn't have much time
to enjoy their accomplishment.
For about a month, they were busy fixing bugs
and optimizing the game for PC.
After that was done, they began the more challenging
task of porting the game to consoles.
This was especially daunting because Beau
and Teddy had already left the team to pursue
other projects.
Consequently, Alx and Eric Melcher, who had
handled the Mac and Linux ports, were responsible
for the console versions.
Fortunately, YoYo Games offered assistance
in making the game playable on PlayStation
and Xbox.
Another unexpected challenge was obtaining
platform certification, which involved extensive
paperwork.
Each region had its own set of rules and limitations.
Additionally, securing a game rating for each
region proved costly, amounting to several
thousand dollars.
It was a much more complicated experience
than working with Steam, which gives developers
a lot more control.
The successful navigation through these challenges
was only made possible thanks to the excellent
representatives at Sony and Microsoft that
worked closely with Heart Machine.
Reflecting on the entire development process,
Alx mentioned that he would have preferred
to have fewer and simpler Kickstarter rewards
and tiers.
The production of physical goods turned out
to be a nightmare for the team, as it took
precious time away from working on the game.
Additionally, he expressed regret over promising
to port the game to so many platforms.
Heart Machine had to cancel the WiiU and Vita
versions, which was a difficult decision that
led to disappointment both among backers and
within the team itself.
On a more positive note, Alx mentioned that
developing, releasing and porting Hyper Light
Drifter to consoles, all without a publisher,
was a great learning experience and taught
them everything they needed to know for their
future projects.
The studio continues to thrive, having released
'Solar Ash' in December 2021, set in the same
universe as Hyper Light Drifter.
As of this video's release, the studio is
working on 'Hyper Light Breaker', another
game in the Hyper Light Drifter universe,
which is slated to be released in early access
in 2024.
Unlike the original, Hyper Light Breaker is
set in a 3D world and will feature both single-player
and cooperative online multiplayer gameplay.
Additionally, in March 2019, it was announced
that a limited animated television series
based on Hyper Light Drifter is in development.
Alx Preston, alongside Adi Shankar, known
for his work on the 'Castlevania' series,
are currently writing the episodes and developing
the series' visual style.
They are focused on blending the game's iconic
pixel art style with a more traditional anime
aesthetic.
Alx couldn't be more grateful for the incredible
support and feedback his games have received.
While fan art always brings a smile to his
face, it's the medical stories from people
around the world that have deeply touched
him.
“It’s been one of the most incredible
aspects of this whole process.
To have people willing to share such intense
experiences with a stranger – one they have
found enough common ground with to find the
courage to do so – is stunning.
I'm always open to hear people's stories,
and when they're genuine like that - when
a complete stranger is willing to share those
secrets and disabilities and what they're
going through - I understand perfectly where
they're coming from.
It reminds me to take a moment outside of
my own struggles.
It’s also deeply inspiring for me to know
that I’ve had any kind of meaningful impact
or effect on people.
I can’t ask for much more.”
