hello today we are going to do a deck
review that means i'm going to go
through a pitch deck intended for
investors and people interested in the
business and i'm going to review and
critique it this is ad hoc it's coming
from mastermind chat a company called
streambee that has been there for a
while actually and uh i want to give
some feedback because i think this is
one of the most
the one of the best ways weirdly to
learn about how to build a pitch deck
and how to sell your company is just to
like look through
a pitch deck and see somebody else do it
so i love doing these reviews i think
it's one of the most like educational
things you can do and uh let's get
started i have not seen this deck other
than just like opening it right now
so
it's going to be completely ad hoc i
have seen
hundreds of decks so
i always enjoy
doing these things okay so first slide
is stream b business intelligence for
creators all right so that could we
could use a better tagline i think
business intelligence for creators is um
good
oh i'm gonna caveat this by saying uh by
the way obviously this person gave me
permission the uh the ceo i believe
which is here in mastermind chat was
like hey send me your deck i'll review
it and happy roasting everyone okay so
there you go before i
before i get into it
we could use the uh a better
tagline i think
um
it's it it doesn't necessarily have to
be changed i kind of like business
intelligence for creators okay what kind
of creators what are they creating um
tell me more right it's kind of a tell
me more statement so i like the way that
this starts um but
you could make a clearer tagline of
exactly what you do but okay like this
wouldn't like cancel me out i'm gonna
keep going
so i am a creator okay
youtube and twitch this is a really good
use of space
i i really like this one of the things
that um
is a number one problem uh i think i see
in dex
is there is too many words
and this deck doesn't have that problem
it's really simple um so i am a creator
i'm not sure if this is referring to
an individual
um
it looks like it is
so but the way that i initially took
that was
i am a creator like
or i am a brand i'm a creator looking at
this presentation
so
this
i guess starts off with
a person who is talking about themselves
okay so maybe they feel like they have
to justify
uh like this i don't like that if that's
the case um this is a really well done
slide but i don't like leading with this
i like leading with problems
so
what am i trying to solve
right um or why am i am i trying to
solve it
uh or leading with
an industry
statement or problem is good too like a
good way to lead like a first slide is
like the gaming industries influencers
aren't making any money right okay
that's interesting um and then maybe a
couple things to support that so this um
appears to be a qualifying statement of
i'm a creator okay cool so they started
on youtube in 2008 and they started on
twitch in 2015 and they got some
good stuff okay
so now we're at this slide the shift
capitalize the s
uh anyone can become a creator the
barriers to become a creator are gone
all you need is a smartphone
but reaching success is damn hard it is
now becoming more difficult to succeed
and stay at the top
okay
uh also i i think this should be a
consistency one of the things i like to
do when i'm seeing titles you see how i
capitalize things that aren't uh
conjoining words so like if you say
anyone can become a creator i would
write this as anyone can become a
creator and then i actually write this
as anyone can become a creator
so in dex
emphasis is really important and you
want to like capitalize or uh like your
your your your key statements
anyone can become a creator's like
better copy
so
especially if it's capitalized just
implies like the statement you're trying
to make is there's there's it's too easy
to become a creator but it's too hard to
become successful
um so you could even say something like
but success
is
damn hard i like the statement damn hard
um it's a little bit
it's like intentionally jarring in a
presentation because like you would kind
of expect a little bit more
professionalism i don't actually like
the professionalism take where it's like
we need to stay in this sort of
corporate line i i think it's actually
really good to like and again i'm not
even capitalized damn for the same
reason that you capitalized anyone
it is now becoming more difficult to
succeed i would maybe even capitalize
more
um you just have to like look at these
statements on their own it's now
becoming more difficult to succeed and
stay at the top
okay
so i don't like the shift
um i actually like the problem i think
the shift is like way too web three like
new agey
when you're trying to describe a problem
um
because it's trying to imply like a a
market transition
but in reality like it's just a problem
okay
so now
we've kind of like non-sequited over to
welcome to the age of the creator
economy a 104 billion dollar market um
slight point
very good to define your total
addressable market that's your tam early
in the in the presentation
this is a interesting way of doing it
and i like it
so um
this actually
might even be
actually okay i would remove this first
slide since this is like
pointless put this here in the this is
the first light and this is the second
slide you see how that flows better so
now welcome to the age of the creator
economy a 400 billion dollar market that
is interesting creator economy is a
great term and then you have your total
addressable market as the first slide
now investors are always interested in
total addressable market total
addressable market means how much
if if i were to own 100 if you were to
become the next amazon right and you own
basically 100 of the market what is the
tam what is the total amount of people
that could potentially buy or use this
service the higher the total addressable
market the
higher um
valuation you could perceivably be at
when your company becomes successful so
some investors will actually like check
in or out depending on certain total
addressable markets the creator economy
is not a 104 billion dollar market and
any and somebody that is intelligent in
the influencer marketing space will
catch you on this and you have to be
careful about that uh there is no shot
that the creator economy is a 104
billion dollar market unless you're
going to define that below uh as an
investor in the creator
and i invest in companies that do
influencer marketing i i would shoot you
shoot out of this immediately first
slide so you better have data to back
this up if you if you think it's 104
billion dollars because i think it's not
so this side won the slide two and you
want to make sure like okay so for
everybody watching like your
your slide should be a story and your
story should evolve your story should
start with a very powerful statement
right
your slide
should be your your presentation
should be a story
and
it should start with a powerful
statement
and then a powerful problem
so i like that's why i'm saying this is
slide one and this is slide two welcome
to the age of the creator economy bam
here's a total addressable market here's
the problem we lead right into the story
see good okay
all right
this slide here says there's 50 million
plus creators and 2 million plus
professionals this is a totally
pointless slide i'm not taught to care
about this slide and i don't care about
this slide i don't even know how to
define creators or professionals yet
because you haven't defined either those
terms for me
you're assuming that i know those terms
but as an investor or a vc i probably
don't know those terms
the influencer market is like a really
new thing even to vcs and
i i don't immediately know how to
differentiate between professionals and
creators i assume because it's in purple
that it's be they mean like partners of
some kind or or i don't know how you
define this so this is this slide is not
good um
okay and now we're like at a problem but
i thought this was the problem
so so i think this slide
also doesn't matter let's see growing is
difficult for the 99
okay creators use five to seven
platforms on average
65
list algorithm changes as their number
one
pain point and no cross cross-platform
intelligence tools are available
okay so keep in mind at this point
i don't know what the hell you do i
don't know what a creator is i don't
know what a professional is i don't know
what algorithm changes are i don't even
know what platforms we're talking about
right like like i have no idea what this
is about
and so i every investor at this point
i'm an expert in this space and i don't
know what you're talking about right
like but every investor that's under me
which is like everyone there's like
almost nobody that has the the knowledge
that i have like individually on this
kind of stuff like is gonna be lost i'm
lost okay that's not a good sign so so i
here we are at slide like number five i
don't know what's going on uh like like
we haven't defined the customer we
haven't defined the we've we've defined
the market kind of but we've said it's
the creator economy so what does that
mean is that everybody that creates
content is that everybody on youtube is
that everybody on tiktok is that like
what is that right okay um but we're
starting to like like if we're gonna be
as charitable as possible we're starting
to we're starting to see that this
company is telling us
that
uh
this is something about influencers
and they have a they have a problem that
they use too many platforms
and um
that it's difficult for them to grow
okay
um
no cross-form cross-platform
intelligence tools are available this is
not true there are multiple
cross-platform
tools available like twitch tracker.net
or solenome or um uh
uh vid iq or well there's so many
there's right so you don't wanna make a
statement like this unless you can back
it up um
stream hatchet or it sells intelligence
data or um what's another one the the
ones that we use um
social blade yeah there's so many cross
intelligence like socialblade's a great
example of a cross intelligence platform
right it immediately tells you how many
followers you have across like youtube
twitch facebook instagram twitter tech
talk and you can see growth and things
like that that's by definition an
intelligence platform so be careful with
statements like this because investors
will call you out on them um
okay
the solution we take all of these
platforms
we put it in a honeycomb
we write business intelligence
and we have creators
okay
so uh from the from the from the basis
of this i am now getting the idea that
this is like a consolidation platform
for social media platforms that
if you you can take all this stuff and
then you can post it stuff here so now
i'm thinking that this is like maybe
like a hootsuite type product like like
a buzz type product like like a thing
that uh where maybe i can schedule
tweets on here as well as like use
discord or things like that so maybe
this is a platform to consolidate
platforms that's my current idea of this
company now that i'm reading this slide
um god knows i haven't been told at all
what it is from from here i have no idea
okay cool so uh this slide doesn't
explain the solution
okay um stream b
introducing stream v okay we're on slide
seven and we're now introducing the
company
here we go boys okay which games should
i play on mondays if i stream between
9am and 4pm to get the most viewers
how many followers do i gain per hour in
my fortnite streams
we empower creators to make informed
decisions through actionable insights
cool i like this that's a good sentence
that tells me what you do
that should be earlier in the deck
um with stream b creators grow faster at
worm and revenue
great okay got it cool why delete all
this what is all this
tell me about this this is a good slide
uh this is a lot of like that's
like graphs and numbers that doesn't
matter i don't particularly care
if the pictures and the graphs um
don't matter
that's fine actually right like um
as long as it like looks like numbers
and graphs and numbers going up and down
like it's fine you don't have to like
really make your pictures explain things
as long as your your text and your
presentation does
uh i don't like these quotes because
investors have no idea what you're
talking about i know what you're talking
about because i'm a creator but i don't
know but the investor won't know what
you're talking about nor are these
quotes relevant but um i would literally
just delete these quotes and then i
would say this
and then that makes sense to me i would
also use the word influencers over
creators because influencers um although
it's like in our community it's a more
of a buzzword but in the investing
community um and everybody understands
the idea of influencer marketing and and
again it kind of like puts you in a
certain place
um
with stream b influencers grow faster
and earn more revenue cool okay so now i
i know what you do
um and i have questions that's good
really good slide
stream b's data engine
can drive best in class insights for
creators and brands our goal is to have
the best understanding of the creator
and their audience and to have the most
data about them
yeah it's a great slide i have no
problem with this slide
yeah no problem it's worded really well
um i think again it's a good expansion
on what you on what the site what the
company does
great okay
the stream be money engine
okay so we've got
a creator
with behavioral data going to the
honeycomb
to the unique creator insights which
goes to the brand which gives money to
stream b which gives money to the
creator
and then
the stream also gives actionable
insights and data powered ultra target
access all right this is a show
this slide doesn't make any sense to me
um
if you're gonna set this site up set up
like a flywheel where flywheels are
great investors love flywheels okay um
show
how
one thing leads into another like you're
trying to do that via this like complex
like hexagonic egyptian hieroglyphic
thing um
just draw a circle and be like creator
stream be brand here's how it filters i
don't understand i i don't understand
how stream b
collects money
in this instance and as a further
commentary on that i never understand
how uh platforms like these people uh
collect money so i just have no idea how
you make money off this this tells me
nothing
i don't like it no sir i don't like it
okay um influencer marketing is
projected to become a 26 billion dollar
market by 2025. i thought that you were
a 104 billion dollar market uh-oh which
is it any investor will catch that
that's not good now this number is
actually right that's why i called you
on the 104th thing i didn't know you had
this in there i've literally i'm looking
at this for the first time right um this
is a
this is correct
this is a a really iffy number because
you're kind of including like all the
cpm stuff in adwords which doesn't like
really go to creators like 45 of that
goes to youtube and
this is a really weird number to use but
it's generally accepted by investors
okay um i don't know why you have
another total adjustable market slide
that contradicts your first total
addressable market slide this is not
good you do not want to ship with this
but the
statement is fine
um see there's a there's a problem here
that like
in this slide we're communicating with
people who clearly have to understand
influencer marketing to to watch to view
this slide
but in this slide we're talking to them
like they're idiots so
which is it if you're going to sell me
directly an investor in the creator
space then uh you talk to me like this
if you're going to don't but don't
patronize me i know what the influencer
market is right like i don't need a
slide like this so which is it i would
recommend you communicate assume you're
talking to people who don't know what
they're doing right because um
the people that do know what they're
doing will tolerate it uh and people
that don't know what they're doing will
have too many questions
all right so now we're back at
explaining something
there's no story here it's just this
just like a hodgepodge of slides i
almost feel like i got these not in
order like maybe i did by the way i'm on
slide 12 right now i'm on slide
12.
12 slides in
and i still don't know what you do it's
driving me crazy okay creators care
about their ego that's true that's the
most true statement of this thing
congratulations i've never seen anything
more true than that
and making money okay um viewers and
followers subscribers donations brand
activations and sponsorships okay um i
mean i understand this slide i agree
with it i don't know why it's in here
already we're helping 3000 creators so
this is what we would call a qualifying
statement
um
and then we've got the team okay we got
martin over here pictures are good this
is well done this is a very good team
slide um creators since 2008 industry
network
product managers that built products for
millions of users
we got this dude he's a cmo at a live
agent and then he doubled their revenue
also good um then we got this guy he's
got a nice beard and he's a full stack
engineer okay i love this slide this is
a very good slide because here's why
this is a really good slide it
demonstrates
uh three very important areas of
competency for the business you've got a
ceo that's a guy that's gonna run
he's gonna get stuff done right you've
got a cmo that means you go to vision
for marketing and strategy and
advertising and you have a cto that
means you can actually build the
thing so these are the three most
important things to have on a slide and
he has them and um he's got good
face pictures smiling people this is a
very good slide i would i think this
team slide is the best sled on the deck
it's really good um it it also the the
strategy statements of like what we do
they qualify really well so it's like
doubled revenue to seven million dollars
arr okay well that shows me without
knowing anything about uh matt tage
a guy's name i can't even pronounce i
know that he can sell that's good
right that's really good and without
knowing anything about jacob
uh i know that he can build good
right um
actually the person that i have the
least confidence in here is the ceo
right because um i understand that he
built products for millions of products
for millions of users but um
what did he run why can he run why
can't why can he build this business why
is he in this position these two people
are uh justified really well through
their respective positions he's a cmo
and he doubled revenue of the company
that's what a cmo should do right so
that's good and this guy's a cto and he
was a full stack engineer and he built
um
what did he build
uh-oh okay so i'm now i don't i don't
maybe i have as much confidence in this
guy too we got to figure out what he
built
uh so there's some statement here
amateur esports competitor in fifa i
don't care about this as a cto i changed
my answer uh this is uh this is a very
weak point um
i also don't care that you are a creator
and i think you should drop that because
like
i saw that up here too i mean he
literally starts with i am a creator you
got to kill this slide this light is so
bad um nobody cares like like uh
investors i don't care if you are a
creator or whatever um you have to
qualify to me that you understand the
market believe me you being a twitch
streamer does it does the opposite
you're you're you're selling you're
selling yourself out of a deal
okay if you if you open up to an
investor like me that says okay um hey
i'm a twister i would be like
oh well uh look at the time i gotta get
going oh this is uh this is uh
yeah like right like that's i i don't
your qualifying statement can't be i'm a
creator you gotta do better than that
you gotta you gotta show why you're a
leader but really good slide it's like
it's like really well done for the
reasons i said i just gotta change like
all that stuff okay
we are now at slide 15
boys and we've got the ask we are now
raising 600 000 to 800 000 but we've
already got 340k committed that is
amazing with a deck like this who gave
you that money that's insane we raised
250 thousand dollars preceded april 2021
and i launched buzz what's buzz first
time i've ever heard of it uh in this
slide deck launching at the end of march
it's currently a closed prototype
3000 creators in the community and 600
waiting lists so
um
this is a better slide than it looks i
do like that there's an ask here it's
very straightforward i thought i think
that's great it also demonstrates that
they have raised money so they're not
like complete in income poops so they
they're capable of convincing someone to
give them their money that's good
launched buzz
doesn't tell me anything i don't know
what buzz is because i'm an investor
looking at this for the first time and i
have no idea what that is um the last
statement 3000 creators in the community
and 600 to waiting list is extremely
strong that means to me that these
people have shown that they can get
customers one of the things that holds
companies back
from getting an investment is they can't
demonstrate any users
so a lot of the time we'll get pitches
and they'll be like hey um
i
have this idea for this product it's
gonna be really cool i'm like okay
well have you focus grouped it have you
adwords tested it have you like run even
100 bucks at ppc and like showed me
that you can get customers interested in
this is there an email list what is
there all right well there's nothing
it's just my idea i think it's good okay
you know i'm not gonna put you know
millions of dollars into your idea
if uh
because you think it's cool right i need
someone else to think is cool and he
says 3000 people think it's cool and 600
people are waiting
they're waiting so they're waiting a
long time because they think that it's
cool okay that's neat so i like that
it's not a huge market but it's a start
and all you're at alpha so you're in a
pre-seed round so the start is good
right so very very strong statement um
featuring more of this and less like
launch like there's two launching things
that i just don't see the point of
join us on our mission to empower
millions of creators with brands with
actionable insights
okay i don't care about the slide uh
this slide is pointless and a context
slide contact slides are good oh my god
we have bonus slides it's not over
20 slides is way too long for a
presentation
seven to nine max
this is literally a slide just to tell
me those bonus slides why
why is it not part of the why is it just
not part of the presentation does it
mean i don't have to
look at these because i won't i i i
don't have time all right i'm an
investor very important
we're building business intelligence
yeah i got that you told me that already
you never defined it but you told me the
way we bring creators into our ecosystem
is with monetization and growth tools
okay what tools
what how are you how do you i have no
idea
from this
how you make money the only thing i've
ever heard about you making money is
this arrow telling me that money goes
places
i don't know how you make this money
i i don't know how much money you've
made that's a really important thing
right have you made any money off this
product you got three thousand credits
are you making any money you're like was
there any money what are you doing for
those creators
i don't know they're in a discord
right you've gotten 3000 people to click
a discord link that's all i know
uh then i got some arrows analytics
okay
stream hatchet i know those guys what
are they doing for you social blades so
you literally said up here
that
uh
there are no cross-platform intelligence
tools available
but down here you're working with these
cross-platform
tools which is it
what the hell
but then you got some marketplaces so
there's like we hype power spike these
are like uh brand and creative
marketplaces tools for streamers stream
live stream elements those are the big
two guys that uh
i think creator education pipeline
that's uh
uh snoopy's company the clg
uh snoopy's company
uh for educating critters all this
goes into stream b are are these your
partners oh these are your competitors
i didn't read the top of the slide
that's my bad but see i that's that
these are all your competitors oh well
that's terrifying i thought you didn't
have any competitors because you have no
cross-platform
intelligence tools available
these are the kind of things that
investors love to bernie but i would
love to you about this right
in your presentation raise my hand yeah
yeah what no crosstalk what about social
blade what about slow down what about
twitch tracker what about twitch
okay yeah okay so don't put that in your
sleds i'm i'm i'm hyper focused on that
i'm just angry about that statement now
okay
creator education
so all these people
are you're going to solve the problems
of all these things
um
i don't believe you and you've given me
no reason to believe you
uh because you haven't even told me what
you do
okay so if this was shark tank i would
immediately toss this out i have no idea
this is a hodgepodge of um
of of it's just a mess of
information
in various forms no flow
uh no real clear idea of how you make
money how much money you've made
um
i there are some things done very well
team with a few exceptions
the ask
um and you know also uh i i want to like
be a little bit more positive the
overall branding is really strong the
yellow and black is a super super good
color scheme i think it's it's really
great it hasn't really been done before
and you can also incorporate twitch
purple which is really good so i think
the branding has been done i like this
little bee with the question marks
that's basically me and wanted to give
the presentation this slide this
personifies me as an investor looking at
this presentation
holding a piece of paper wondering what
the you're talking about
is uh is 100 where i'm at so this is um
this is a great beep i like him a lot i
like it but not enough to invest in him
he's pretty cool though he's neat
so yeah um i'm this bee
and uh your bread is really good the
honeycomb super good
the name is good too stream b i like it
and i i love it actually it's like a bee
that works right bees work and they they
go around and they
bring honey to the hive i got it okay um
many of your slides are just outright
unnecessary why is it important that
creators care about their ego and make
money why is it important that like well
i said the slide is good right no
problem with that slide yeah and this
side's good
uh why is this important like join us on
our mission to empower creators yeah
delete half these slides delete over
half of these slides end up with like
maybe eight to nine slides max and then
tell a story um and if you improve the
slides the way that i said i i think
this is a passable deck the um
brain is good the problem is that like
you just have to add something about
what you do man like like i i understand
now
that you're a platform for creators but
you could like include like your ui
and you could
show kind of like more or less how you
solve these problems for creators
and what you do
because right now i have no idea
okay
i'm this bee
that's the end of my video i hope this
helps
i would be curious to do another review
of a deck like this after and if you
have uh stuff that you want me to review
you can uh always post it in mastermind
chat i'll put it on patreon okay bye
