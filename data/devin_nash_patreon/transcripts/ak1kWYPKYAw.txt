hello today we are going to talk about
how to do amazing calls to action this
is something that you need to know no
matter what kind of business you run or
really anything that you do in life
calls to action are extremely important
i have thought about calls to action for
a long time i think that it is the most
important thing that you need to know if
you are speaking to an audience in
general so we're going to discuss how to
do it in the context of
talking to brands being a business being
a content creator
or whatnot
so one thing to understand first off i
think about calls to action well let's
define calls action first right so call
to action is really just when you have a
platform where you have an audience
you're making a video or you're talking
to a client it is getting them to do
something so a call to action um for a
content creator might be very obvious
hey guys go follow my channel but it
might be less obvious for someone like a
client when you're working for a
business so one of the best calls of
action that you can do just tons of
value like right off the bat with this
video
hopefully
is uh you could for example say to a
client that you just sold a product or
service to if let's say you're doing a
service hey could you recommend me to
one other person that you think could
use my services so i have seen local
businesses build themselves just on that
call to action alone so call to action
can range a wide gamut of different
types of things and so getting
effective at calls to action should be a
priority for you because most people
will not do something generally unless
you tell them to and this is a
fundamental thing you need to understand
um so much so that i think we have to
switch over and we are going to take
some notes
so rule number one is
most people will not do something unless
you tell them to
and to go along with this rule
rule number two
is
most people who want to give calls to
action
will feel bad
about calling on their community
clients etc to do the thing
so let's focus on these two rules first
because i think the first thing to talk
about here before we even get into
technique or go any kind of tactical is
we have to talk about the barrier
because i promise you that rule number
two is going to stop you more than any
tactical techniques or ability that i
give you
so most people think that if someone
likes what you do
or wants to buy something from you
they will do so on their own volition
and it feels bad
naturally bad for most people to say hey
go buy my thing i'm i have a book out
right now and i want you to go buy it
that generally feels bad because we
think in our mind well if a person
really likes my stuff and they know
about my book they'll go buy it and
therefore for me to actually kind of
like
get them to go buy it by telling them
directly or even asking them to do it
is in some way kind of subverting the
natural sales process and is kind of
imposing upon them and most people think
this way the truth is that even for your
supporters who want to
do something for you and would be happy
to give you money
uh
they will most likely not do that on
their own voting unless told to do so
and
or or really let me um switch the
language here and let's say they're not
told to do so let's say they're given
permission to do so i think that's like
a way
better told versus given permission
and we could also say
instead of directed versus informed okay
so
here's a really cool concept this is
gonna be so much cool stuff in this
video like
i think it's a really important video
so if you think about your brand or your
business
or your content nobody knows more about
that than you
you will automatically assume that your
customer base understands more about you
than they actually know the vast
majority of people will not know obvious
things about your brand or about your
product or things that are obvious to
you because you think
you think from the perspective only that
you are the most engaged with your
particular product or service but other
people are engaged to a lesser degree
right nobody knows your product like you
so the the most engaged person
next to you is only going to be 99
engaged where you're 100 engaged they
won't know everything they're not in
your head but
no one will be 99 engaged they'll be
like
even
so if i take somebody that like
listens to every single video i make
and because there's some people that
listen to every video i make and there's
even people that comment commentate on
every video i make on every youtube
every patreon they make a comment
there's people like that
and they still don't know
i would say more than like 60
of the
amount of stuff that i do
or like or or like what i'm offering
okay and so i would still even then need
to give a call to action to that person
remember that we have a concept in
marketing which is called localized
audiences or dedicated audiences where
marketing exists as a series of
concentric circles
where your most dedicated audience
operates in a very very tiny circle
right here
and these are the people that are going
to have some idea of like your core
content and like your all of your
product offerings or whatever but even
these people need to be called to action
but you're mostly speaking to like the
90 of people that sit out here where
they really need calls to action because
they may not even know what you sell
now you might think okay
um let's say somebody knows what uh
i sell but i feel bad about giving them
a call to action because i um i'm not
like confident that this can provide
value to them so
you need to know that the product or
service that you are offering is
providing value to people and solving
problems if you have a customer base
already you are already solving a
problem for them you know that your
product is good and your service is good
because you're solving a problem for
them so you need to find like-minded
people and look to solve that problem
for them right now the problem that my
company novo solves is that most
influencer deals are bad most influencer
deals do not consider proper
deliverables they don't consider proper
influencers that might be excited about
the brand they don't consider the brand
they don't consider the the fit there
our company solves that problem and i'm
confident that if i
am talking to a brand i'm going to
connect you with a campaign that is
going to outperform
almost anything else you can find it's
going to be way more hands-on it's going
to be way more directed and i know that
value-add so i'm not i'm not
uncomfortable
um
asking that brand to
do work on a project with me or work on
a campaign or or pay me money quite
literally because i know that value i'm
going to provide let's make it a little
bit more like most people are not in
that position so let's go to like
content creation i am not i do not mind
asking people to subscribe to my patreon
right so if you go into my my main
youtube i will have talked to most
people you'll see almost every video hey
subscribe to my patreon
and the reason for that is because if
you pay me five dollars you get 52
videos as of the time of this recording
that are high tactical business stuff
that i know for a fact you would have to
pay thousands of dollars for from a
like-minded individual for my person at
this level of success in business giving
that information there are very few
services like it there are some sure um
that are on youtube with legitimate ceos
that give great content for free but i
know that value of that product i'm okay
asking for it so you have to do one of
two things or both of these things one
you have to really identify the problem
that you're solving and be confident in
it and then number two you need to
increase the value of your product or
service until you're confident enough
that it um that you can ask people to do
things for it because i don't feel
guilty and you shouldn't feel guilty if
you're providing true value to people
which is what you always should be doing
you should always really be desperate to
try to provide value to people and i
think most of you are so most of you
will run into the sort of imposter
syndrome of oh i'm just not good enough
um to be able to offer this even though
you're actually in the in the business
of like selling it it's a weird
juxtaposition that people put in
okay so
that's just kind of to like start
centering around the mental stuff before
we get to kind of like the tactical
stuff most of you will feel too bad and
even after watching this video you will
not do consistent call to action but if
you are a content creator you need to be
doing call to action on every single
stream on every single video and you if
you're on a stream you need to do them
once an hour if you're on a if you're on
a video you need to do them at least
twice a video if you are a if you are a
business and you're selling a product
you need to have a part of your sales
cycle
where you are asking them to do
something whether it's being you're
asking them to buy or in or in
retrospect after they have purchased
you're asking them to review or offer a
testimonial you should challenge every
one of your customers to do something to
stay engaged in your loop that's that's
that is your job that is your obligation
as a business owner so um you have to
understand rule number three
once you get over the mental stuff most
people need to be told what to do
need to be told what to do
why well the reason we mentioned before
maybe people are not get well not maybe
definitely people are not as engaged
with your product as you think they are
but also people that want to support you
may need that personal touch from you to
uh tell them
the best way to support you
um which could be to buy your product it
could be to subscribe on twitch it could
be to subscribe to your youtube channel
right different calls to action and
explaining the why behind a person ought
to do something right so let me give you
an example for my youtube channel
hey guys i would really appreciate if
you subscribe i do tons of content
around marketing and deep dives into the
new platform meta of marketing
advertising so if you're interested in
that kind of thing i do more videos like
that come watch them right that's a
direct call to action that explains why
the power the power behind
um why you ought subscribe you should
subscribe because if you're interested
in this topic you're going to get more
uh you're going to get get more videos
like it so that kind of call to action
is different from subscribe to the
youtube right which is a is really an
important distinction and we're starting
to get into some of the
tactical stuff
there's a huge difference in the quality
of of um
of call to action and and the most calls
to action are super duper bad so make
sure to follow the stream is a super
shitty call to action right hey guys i'm
sponsored by um i don't know this phone
and uh yeah thanks uh thanks for
sponsoring the stream thanks for
sponsoring the youtube channel or um
hey um thanks leave a review um about
the product or i i'm a restaurant owner
now okay um hey leave a review if you'd
like to dinner these are super
calls to action and like for the people
that even do call to action their
confidence is so low that they don't
even believe in the thing themselves
enough to give a good call to action so
we're gonna like um we're gonna do good
call to action for every single type of
thing okay um
so for your business
i'm gonna do i'm gonna do a couple of
start there i'll do for content creators
i'll do for brands i'll get to get to do
people uh to get people to do something
to sell a product or service i want to
really emphasize the why behind
something so for my business if i am
pitching a client okay on novo services
all right
most influencer campaigns suck we
believe that we do custom campaigns for
influencers better than anybody else on
the market give me 10 minutes i'll show
you why okay that's a good call to
action right
are you available for a quick phone call
so i can show you why right or um
and these are not scripted by the way
you should pre-plan these but i i'm i've
done this for so many years that i can
just come up with them and do a video
like this but generally you should
pre-plan these and you should have a a
set of these you kind of run through
depending on what you offer or things
like that right um
let's do one for like uh
content creation
or like platform growing okay right um
hey if you enjoyed this video about
marketing you would like a lot you would
like a lot of the other videos that i do
on marketing on this channel so if you
actually subscribe you will get uh
updates on when i make new videos about
marketing stuff first and i and then
like let's even like increase that let's
do like a mr beast type of thing um to
put value into the actual call to action
one no ten subscribers that subscribe
on this video between this video and
next video i will give a hundred dollars
to or i will specifically message and
answer their questions about their brand
or business right you see so like if you
go look at mr b still say something like
the next 1000 people that subscribe will
get a hundred dollars or one person that
subscribes will get ten thousand dollars
right and so um you could say one person
that subscribes is going to get a
hundred dollars i will post the results
and that person's name
in this video um
description in like
uh like a week that's like an incredible
call to action that gets people to
subscribe that's so much stronger than
like subscribe to my youtube channel
like
look say subscribe to my youtube channel
or saying thanks for buying my product
at least that's a little bit better but
like if you want to um
drive incredible calls to action
right explain the why we already
discussed that
and then
give them something
on return so
uh i what for product based businesses
one of the things i really love is hey
if you liked this product um please
leave a review for it
we will send you the next product that
we get for free right if you're like or
or um the next product that you get
will be 15 off with a code or any number
of those things right another one is to
do is like classic one is like hey we'll
give you this product for free if you
leave an honest open review that's a
classic one for like steam games or
things like that those are that's a
really powerful call to action to get
tons of engagement um you'll notice in
my main youtube channel uh for content
creation we're just gonna kind of roll
around good call to actually get an idea
of everything
one of the things i say is hey it's 26
minutes or 30 minutes or 32 minutes into
the video if you've been watching this
long leave a comment and let me know
because i love people that are um
i love people that
spend that kind of time on my videos
you're watching and then i'll give them
like some prestige too so i'm like man
if you're 30 minutes into a devon nash
video like you're dedicated congrats
like let me know like tell me in the in
the section below i love reading that
stuff that's way more powerful than like
leave a comment let me know what you
think and and they'll go into any of my
videos from the past like uh five or ten
videos and go look and see how many
people say hey i'm here at 26 minutes
right that encourages that engagement
that's a strong call to action now that
same person is more likely to that's
comments is more likely to follow and
again if you look at how i do my call to
action i explain why they should follow
the channel i explain why the value is
there and something like a paid service
like patreon right like because i i
genuinely believe that if you are in any
way interested in and running a business
paying five bucks for patreon like for
this patreon would you be insane not to
do it the the amount of videos that you
get the amount of um of like tactical
information you get about running a
business i would i built the service
that i wanted when i was doing
this and when i was learning this i wish
this existed right i wish that somebody
told me about call to action in this way
so you would pay five bucks for that
yeah 100 right um but even if um
but you could do it even if you don't
have like an educational value add like
that so like let's say like subscribing
to a twitch stream like hey guys if you
really care about this stream and you
want to keep me going i'm trying to get
to a x goal so this is the rule
principle number three have a goal right
so we're trying to raise three thousand
dollars to this month so i can do this
full-time i'm currently at 125. if you
subscribe now or donate 10 bucks you
would help me along that goal of me
doing this full time and i'd be here a
lot more for you right so i didn't have
any educational thing or any kind of
thing but i'm just saying i'm setting a
goal i'm explaining the why and i'm
giving them something in return right
i'm accomplishing all three of those
things the thing i'm explaining is i get
to broadcast more if you do this the
thing i'm giving them in return is more
hours of me broadcasting and the goal we
have is three thousand dollars right so
you can do this it doesn't have to be
like some crazy educational product or
anything like that it can it can
literally be um something that you just
sort of think through or makeup right so
um here's another one for like a youtube
um okay guys like
um i'm really trying to grow my youtube
channel if i get
a thousand subscribers on this video
then um
i will make two videos a week instead of
one video a week and right now we're at
200 so if you subscribe right now you'd
really be making a difference in helping
me with that right not educational just
a goal okay um you're selling a product
right so guys i'm looking to sell 500
bags of green tea this month last month
we sold 250 so we need to double that if
you buy a bag of green tea and you're
one of the people that helps us get to
500 i will do 15 off all of my products
next month or um i will release a
special new green tea let me see what
i'm saying just get these three things
in there and explain the why of what you
want to do and the more passionate you
are about that individual thing the more
it will work so one of the things that
i've said about this patreon is that
most of the stuff that i most of the
money that i spend on patreon just goes
back into like research or just like
providing different types of things for
um the content creation aspect of this
right because my i'm employed by novo so
most of the um uh all my life expenses
are that kind of stuff so you actually
actively help me ideate and create this
content by paying for it and i'm here
because people are able to support me on
that level so that's how we get people
that um that know that their money is
not going to me buying like a
lamborghini or whatever it's going into
actually building up the service that
you are paying for so that explains why
it gives you something to return which
is more high quality and and you
get a goal right um setting those those
terms so you can do this for any product
you can do this for any service you can
do this for any business um
i i really love the idea in business so
if you are like what's let's take
product business
let's take service business
let's take a content business
so for service businesses i really like
the idea of calls to action around
reviews
either for free services
um on on
primary platforms
for products i really like
free product in exchange for things
or taking some action
in exchange for
discounts and for content businesses
i really like ctas around
uh different levels of funnel
so at a basic level you might be trying
to get subscribers
or followers
right and i think ultimately as a
content business your your goal is to
get paying people and your goals to be
providing value to paying people and
getting them to do something
so
if you follow these three rules you'll
come up with some great calls to action
so i'm going to give you just a few off
the top of my head um
that are going to come in
so
um here's a good so this is just like a
like these are a pair of earbuds that i
just picked up i'm just gonna come up
with a with a good call to action uh for
my the earbuds that i sell
so one of the things that really
frustrated me about uh like phone calls
was i have either had to like hold the
cell phone to my ear or i have like had
this like which i think is giving me
brain cancer or i've never been able to
find a good pair of bluetooth headphones
and i really like to call my parents
while i'm walking and so i just didn't
have that opportunity i couldn't call
them as much and it made me sad so i
finally found a pair of headphones that
um actually are great quality and also i
don't have to hold a phone to my head so
this is a fantastic pair of headphones
that has really solved that problem for
me i think they saw it for you too you
could find these headphones at right
that's a much stronger call to action
than something like yeah we're sponsored
by um i don't know bluetooth headphones
they're cool i guess thanks guys like
for sponsoring me right so so there's
such a huge and like look i have all the
analytics on the back end of what the
difference of call to actions are when
we educate influencers and educate
business owners and they do calls to
actions that are authentic with stories
attached that they're excited about the
amount of conversions that they get
versus just doing a generic call to
action is astronomical when you explain
why you want more followers it is so
much more meaningful than when um within
somebody just following you but even if
you just ask if you say hey you guys
like uh you can do you can make jokes of
it right so like one of the things i
used to do is i was like i was like hey
hey yep i know you're sitting right
there and you're thinking maybe i should
follow the stream you better do that
right now i better see some follows
right now that works right because it's
kind of like a meme it's kind of funny
you have to have the right personality
for it but you can make that happen but
i like to come from a value standpoint
so it's like hey
uh if you are liking what you're seeing
right now and you want to follow the
stream or you want to subscribe to this
youtube channel i would really
appreciate it because it'll actually
help me do this more full-time i'm
trying to make more high-quality stuff
like this and your support would mean
that i can make more stuff like this
that's so much more powerful and
visceral and emotional than hey guys
follow this right for a service business
okay if you're doing let's say um
consulting okay there's a lot of
consultants and that listen to this um
type of stuff these videos you're a
consultant okay
guys um
i work on this platform and this
platform is how i do business if you
really got something out of um out of
this then please please please leave me
a review on linkedin the description the
link will be right here um it would mean
the world to me because i would be able
to do this more and my goal is to take
on 15 new consulting clients in the next
month which would really help me afford
x or really help me afford like why
right like again giving them that goal
that 15 number very deliberate right and
then giving them something to return
which is the satisfaction of knowing
that they have supported you sometimes
that's enough okay like and then like a
content businesses i've been giving you
a lot of examples of that product
business um i've been giving you a lot
examples of that so um i i really like
uh content i like for product stuff i
really like
call to action that explain the value of
the product and the story behind
why
um
that happened so zappos for example had
a phenomenal call to action around their
shoes which is every pair of shoes that
you buy we will donate another pair of
shoes to somebody in a third world
country it's extremely powerful call to
action you know that by buying this shoe
you are not just like paying some
faceless corporation you are actually
putting a pair of shoes on another
person so if you can set up your product
based business to do something like that
where a portion of your product is
donated to some good cause which you
should always be doing anyway right the
reason why we're in business is to
create value if not for other people but
then for then for um then the world as a
whole remember that too that's probably
a separate video but it's really
important that you're you're in business
business is a is a value generation
system
it's not just about making money in fact
making money is like a really really
like far removed thing you should be in
business and you should be in uh in
service or product or content because
you are trying to provide value value
can be entertainment value can be
education value can be all kinds of
different things but you better be
providing value don't take away from the
world and consume this is one of the
reasons why i'm a big big not a huge fan
at all of like any channels that try to
like manufacture drama or just try to
like react to content i think that's
like in general like taking away from
the world unless it's very done very
uniquely and entertaining it's not
something that um empowers people and i
hate it i i really don't like that kind
of stuff um so always make sure that
you're you're focusing on the ways that
you're empowering people and and like if
you think your product or service or
your content just um isn't enough for
that then back up and figure out how you
you ought to do that so so it's very
easy for example like a very obvious one
is like well um right now i sell
products i've got a 70 margin so it's
like super high i could donate one
percent of my profits to this proceed
that i believe in that that maybe
inspired um
one of the reasons why i started this
business right you can do that like
that's something you could definitely do
and then that gives you a story and it's
and you start to get a better why for
how you do your call to action and by
the way you'll feel better about doing
them so you'll you'll um
you'll be more successful
but if you follow these three rules
explain the why giving them something in
return and having a goal i think you'll
be really impressed by the results and
and then the the whole rest of this game
is just getting over that mental hurdle
in your head of like i'm not good enough
to do this you are you should always be
innovating on the on the product that
you're offering people you should always
be making it better and but in doing so
you should have the confidence that the
product and that you're offering
actually does have real discernible
value and is going to help somebody in
some way because if you don't really
believe that then like what are you
doing right like if you don't like
really step back and be like okay
if i don't believe that the quality of
what i'm offering whether it be
entertainment whether it be a product
whether it be a service if i don't
really believe that that is going to
make somebody better than when they
actually spent money to do it then you
need to be in a different field like you
need to reevaluate it that is the base
that you operate off of and if you do
believe that if you do believe that that
value is there then why are you not
doing more calls to action to tell
people about that value it is a crime if
you don't subscribe to my patreon like
you're like if you're a business owner
in a certain range interested in certain
things and you're interested in in
marketing uh
in new media platforms you not being a
part of my patreon is is is your up
right that's how i look at it because
like um if you
like unless you can't afford it or
whatever and that's why like but but
like literally right so i'm going to
tell you about it i'm going to tell you
but then you'll have to do it but i'm
going to tell you like here's where i
really think that value is and how it's
going to help you and and by the way i
am personally invested in providing you
that value i could sell i mean how long
are we into this video right
we're almost 30 minutes into this video
so there are tons of people who would
sell this kind of stuff as a course and
i could easily go
sell how did how to increase your
youtube revenue
um by 2x and i do i just make uh five 30
minute videos like this put it on
coursera and sell it for 200 bucks can
do that right but it's five bucks it's
actually less than five bucks because in
the context of a monthly membership it's
way less than that because you're
getting other videos get other content
stuff like that right i'm cool doing it
so i know it's valuable i i know it's
and i deliberately don't do that course
 because i think that's less
valuable i think that's less that's not
as good i don't want to spend i don't
want somebody to pay me 200 to learn
this i want someone to pay me five
dollars to learn this or 25 if they want
support and like a mastermind here or
something like that whatever right
whatever their whatever their personal
preference is but it would be a shame
either way for them not to be a part of
this unless it doesn't fit them and then
that's their prerogative but again i'm
going to do those calls to action to get
them to do that right um same with
brands and people that we approach at
novo um if if they don't use our
influencer services i i think that's
that's an l
like right if you're an influencer and
you don't know about our merch services
and the fact that we do end-to-end merch
better than almost anybody there's some
people that do it as good but i don't
think anyone that does it quite as uh
that much better um you should you ought
know that we do merch services and and
our mr services are really good right so
um i can tell you about that and i can
and i can tell you that like we do
end-to-end campaign activations that we
think are better for most brands if
you're brands you should contact me you
