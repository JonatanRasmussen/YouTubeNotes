hey so I have had a lot of people ask me
about how YouTube Discovery works and
how you get videos discovered on YouTube
so I'm going to explain exactly how that
works starting with the sort of
theoretical concept of how the engine
works and then we're going to get into
like literally how it measures it all
right so to get started if you look at a
paint uh we're going to draw a series of
circles okay this is the theoretical
concept first
so what happens when a video is released
is that you're going to start here
at this point where you have a
small circle
that small circle is going to represent
your subscribers
and your initial viewing audience
and so YouTube's gonna take your
subscribers and it's going to choose
some people randomly and it's going to
basically serve them your video and
we're going to decide we're going to
discuss in just a minute what stats it
uses to determine if it to move to the
next level
but basically you can view this as sort
of a level up and like use like gaming
and if these if the stats that matter
fit then YouTube serves to a bigger
Circle and then this turns to a bigger
circle and a bigger Circle and actually
this has no uh theoretical maximum so
that's how videos get billions of views
eventually there could just be a circle
that like basically contains all of
YouTube
and uh it works through an entropy
system so if you have the right stats to
move to the next level
um you get a bigger and bigger Circle
and and so on until basically the stats
decrease
and
um that's no longer relevant so what are
the stats that matter uh here they are
so for the stats that matter the first
one is called avd or average view
duration
uh so how long did someone watch your
video
and there's a corollary stat to this
which is average percentage viewed
which is all available on your dashboard
you can see all this on Analytics
and then
um the next one is going to be
CTR or click-through rate
so how many people actually clicked your
video
um this is also called watch time so
basically like this the stat is just
sort of like the watch time stat
which is super super important and then
the next one is going to be
um let's figure out click through it avd
average percent viewed
and then General engagement stats so
this is going to be likes comments
dislikes
um shares right
so the top priority and engagement stats
is shares that's the most important one
likes and dislikes are equal comments
are higher than likes and dislikes so
um
watch time is the most important
basically if so if you make an eight
minute video
if somebody watches the entire eight
minute video that's going to be a huge
chance to serve to more people
and then CTR is going to be basically
almost entirely related to your
thumbnail and title and how many people
actually click through so a good CTR for
videos is like seven to ten percent is
like 12 is like incredible some people
might uh if you're watching this you're
a very small concert credit you might
see like 20 to 25 CTR that's because
just your subscribers are watching it so
they're clicking on it so you can't use
CTR uh to to evaluate small channels
which a lot of people don't know
um that you just ignore CTR until you're
at like twenty thousand thirty thousand
Subs
but General engagement stats are really
good that's why it's super good to do
calls to action and videos to encourage
like shares likes comments and dislikes
because you can actually boost yourself
in Discovery
uh as a very small Creator by do it by
just getting a lot of Engagement
um and of course avd so basically avd is
um how good is the content
uh CTR is how good is the thumbnail and
title
and uh engagement is
how interesting is it to talk about
Slash controversial
so if you know these levers you can
change them
um basically if you nail 10 out of 10 on
every one of these you have a like
billion view video
which brings us to the next topic which
is
um something that I think a lot of
people don't understand is because it's
a very new change at YouTube and that is
that every single video is its own
Island
so a lot of people look at channels and
how it used to be if you look at your
Channel
then um
you go here and you look at your videos
how it used to be is that YouTube built
an idea of your channel kind of an
identity for your channel based on the
type of content that you did
and so people would make channels
um that were kind of themed
because YouTube would like sort of read
the whole Channel and then serve it to
people
based on like what the channel is about
what it thinks your channel is about
but what has happened in various times I
would say like over the last a year or
so
is that YouTube's algorithm has gotten
so good so it is it is so good at
serving that it can identify
the video itself
we'll call it the UA why a YouTube
algorithm can identify
the video and serve it on its own Merit
it does not require a channel to do that
or really anything else so that is why
you see people that are uploading videos
for their like first time
they can get like millions of views on
the video if they tick all these boxes
because a video gets served inside Merit
so now you might say well
what is the value of a channel then so
like the value of a channel in terms of
identifying what a video is or like how
fast it's going to grow has been
completely depreciated it doesn't matter
what else you have in your channel your
video is not going to become more or
less subscribe successful uh because of
what's on your channel what does matter
is the number of subscribers you have
because of uh this so if you have a lot
of subscribers this circle starts off
bigger because it's going to some of
your your subscribers but if you look at
your YouTube analytics and stats you'll
actually see that the vast majority of
people that are finding your videos are
off of Google Search like 60 to 80
percent and are still not coming from
your subscribers no matter how many
initial subscribers you have so even if
you have unless your video is really bad
then if it's underperforming then mostly
it'll just be your subscribers that
watch it and it won't get served to new
viewers so the advantage of a channel is
that people can subscribe to that
channel and then they get serve
notifications and that makes this circle
bigger so let's say like here you have
like 500 subscribers barely anybody is
going to
um like watch your video because you
still have no subscribers you need these
things to be in order you need really
really good stuff to get served to the
next audience the next audience the next
audience and they have more people
subscribe but if you're like a you know
2 million to 10 million YouTuber you
already start in like this circle or
this circle or whatever so it's way
easier to get that individual video
served out to
um bigger audiences because your
subscribers are going to help your
engagement and help your CTR and will
probably help your avd because they'll
watch longer and they'll engage and and
such okay so that's the that's really
the advantage of channels now is getting
subscribers that's why subscribers are
important so if you understand that
every video can be served on sun Merit
then you need to look at every single
video you produce as a basically like a
um a batting average like you're just
like you're going up to the plate and
you're gonna swing and you're gonna hope
for a home run and you might make 20 30
200 500 videos and the next one could be
the a million view one or the 10 million
view one that's the way to think about
it and it's true so
um each video
is identified by a couple of metrics one
is title two is YouTube description
so what you write in the description a
lot of people make this mistake three is
tags so you get three tags on a video
um if you look at like any of the videos
that I do
you'll see a description
it's like Valor and G2 G2 Esports so I'm
really trying to teach Google like
what's going on here and then you'll see
my tags are customized for everything so
this is hashtag G2 hashtag Esports
hashtag gamingnews right for a twitch
video or something I might do something
like
#twitch hashtag streaming hashtag
gamingnews and I will look for the top
keywords that are being searched
for a video and I will write them in the
description so notice when I say tags I
don't mean tags in the sense of like
um the tags that you put on a video
I mean hashtags so I should always say
hashtags
because I don't mean uh the actual
there's a tag section in the videos
where you can
put a bunch of tags and I actually do
that even though YouTube has said that
it's a depreciated system they've
literally said they don't use it but I
still do it because
I think they do use it but the engineers
have said they don't so who knows um but
yeah so so that's how I identify a video
I actually don't worry about titles that
much so I'd rather use the title to get
really good CTR than I would to like
tell YouTube what it's about but this is
because I'm already an established
YouTuber so a lot of small content
creators they make the mistake of doing
like 39 daf type titles
where
um it's like please don't leave the
video put it in her mouth things like
that but you don't have the equity to
make these weird video titles because no
one knows who you are what you're about
so daf can do this because she has a
existing subscriber base that will then
serve these videos so she can bypass the
um necessity of telling YouTube what
it's about
I can do the same thing because I have
over 100k subscribers but if you're a
small Creator you can't do that you you
can't just um make a weird title and a
weird thumbnail and then expect to grow
based on that you have to tell YouTube
exactly what you're doing so I actually
have several videos where I still do
this because I'm not like it by any
means a huge YouTuber so I say things
like exactly how to grow a massive brand
from zero followers right that's very
obvious what that is
um Elon Musk buys Twitter so I do have
or Destiny's permanent ban right whereas
I could have like worded that something
like
um
biggest political streamers ban or
whatever and and right like maybe I tell
YouTube more about it but I'm telling
YouTube exactly what this is about
so then I have other videos like twitch
has a serious problem or twitch can't
afford to pay it streamers right
um
or like
Esports CEO reveals truth right which
are like more not telling YouTube what
it's about but like talking to the user
directly so I can do a combination but
if you're a small content creator you
pretty much pretty much want to make
engaging titles that tell YouTube what
uh it's about and when I say tell
YouTube I mean like tell YouTube the
robot so you speak to the robot instead
of speaking to to viewers to get started
the video I mean obviously you still
want to make compelling titles
um but yeah it's gonna drive more uh if
you if you do that at this point
okay so title YouTube description and
hashtags are how each video is basically
identified and then of course like
Google YouTube's like proprietary AI
which involves um
all kinds of things you can't control
you don't need to worry about like
everything from how you like what the
things you are that you say in the video
like there's a there's actually OCR so
like actually recognizes like the words
you use and it's going to put you in the
right direction it's very good at this
so like you will not be able to fool the
system and you should never write
descriptions or titles that are uh not
about what you're actually talking about
so don't try to game this this is a um
it will tank your engagement as soon as
YouTube realizes that you're doing this
and they're incredibly good at it
they're better than you will you will
never out think this system because
there are people that upload like
hundreds and thousands of videos that
are about like random political stuff or
like click bait videos that don't have
anything to do with it and YouTube deep
has learned how to de-prioritize that
stuff really well there are still some
that break through the system but
generally you don't want to build a
brand on that because YouTube system is
getting smarter faster than you ever
will be and you better be talking about
the thing that you're actually
advertising
um because not only will you piss off
YouTube's algorithm and they'll de-rank
you but you'll also piss off the people
that you're trying to be interested in
your long-term subscribers this is not a
good idea make titles and thumbnails
that deliver on what you're talking
about like
um and this is kind of an issue because
like twitch can't afford to pay their
streamers is not exactly true right like
obviously they can
um and twitch didn't really tweet this
we're lowering your pay because twitch
is expensive but it's just enough in the
gray area that like people know that
this is kind of a hyperbolic title right
now if I said something like factually
like
um twitch is out of money even that
would actually be okay I could probably
get away with it but it's a little bit
more like weird right
um
let's say I did something like I'm
trying to be like really extreme uh here
we go so like twitch
will stop paying his streamers in 2023.
now like if I made that video would I
get a lot of Engagement and like clicks
yeah but I'm lying I don't know if
that's true right so I'd never do
something like that
um I I can kind of be in this kind of
gray area you can kind of be in the
square area but you you like I'll say
something is the end of Esports coming
right
um is it like like let's see let's talk
about it and I won't say the end of
Esports is in 2023 right whereas I would
get more engagement on that title if I
did but I'd be lying to the algorithm
I'd be lying to my viewers because I
don't really know that so it really um
lowers your authority to do that kind of
stuff so don't do that stuff
if you can avoid it actually just don't
do it okay all right so that said um
here's all a bunch of [ __ ]
um there are other things that I look at
analytical dashboard is like uh how many
new viewers came in versus returning
viewers how many Subs did I get per
video those are kind of interesting
things right but
um I'm gonna say that like I think that
there's a real problem uh because
YouTube analytics are so good I think
there's a problem with people that look
at the analytics and try to make
decisions like based on everything I
just said and are making decisions to
like maximize like avd CTR and like
engagement
um when you really should be thinking
about more subjective things about the
video so like I do not look at and this
is like a guy like a lot of people think
I'm like a stats guy and I guess I mean
at an agency level I am at a macro level
or I'm looking at like either macro sets
of data or like tight sets of data
around like particular categories or
things like that
but like when it comes to my own videos
and content creation
I don't care about avd CTR and
engagement stats that much I don't
really look at it because
um I'm thinking about things like what
makes this interesting
um how's my pacing right is this still
interesting X minutes in right like uh
how accurate am I and because I'm an
educator
so I need to be really accurate right
um but like an Entertainer might say
like
um
like might think in terms of Beats right
where it's like one minute three minutes
five minutes
something interesting happening at all
these points
this is how creators like Mr Beast like
Jimmy he basically was able to
make it in the most successful YouTube
channel in the world basically just by
pacing in beats those are like the two
things that he really focuses on which
is like okay
something needs to be interesting and he
understands when the the attention is
going down because the the the part of
the video that you're on is just not as
interesting so he kicks it back up with
some like explosion or something that's
like exciting and actually if you look
at like top twitch streamers they do the
same thing where like they'll they'll
bring it back into something interesting
because they sort of intuitively know
when the content is like losing its
luster in that moment okay so beats are
really important and like pacing is
really important I think
um is the actual topic interesting
trendy and like good right so like is
this something that people are talking
about this is really the one that I do
that has made my channel successful so I
understand what people are talking about
because I'm a full-time marketer and I
just like know what's going on so I will
usually make videos about things that
are in the conversation
and I don't actually follow the rules of
like beats or pacing
I follow the rule of what makes this
interesting and how accurate am I and is
the topic actually interesting and I can
make a successful YouTube channel based
on that keep in mind like on average I
upload once a month right so I am not
I'm by no means like a full-time content
creator and I still do very well this
channel makes full-time income
and make a lot more if uh
yeah that's mainly because of my high
CTR though so crcp on this kind of
unfair
uh because I I run in a really high CPM
category but they're deliberately so
yeah anyway so like is the topic
actually interesting and trendy and good
um and what makes it interesting and
like I don't care about pacing because I
do 45 minute videos that have really
good information so like I will talk
about something where the right person
that is interested will want to listen
to the whole thing which ends up being
like 25 of my audience and then the rest
are like you know gonna kind of Click
through and get some good ideas out of
it I'm fine with either that like you
know my job is to like put out the good
information that people care about but
that said like I don't like really care
about this stuff like if I cared about
avd I would make you know 15 minute
videos that would have that out of focus
really hard on like pacing
um making them interesting at different
times I was script the whole video
through right like I'd make sure those
beats are on point to get that avd up to
get people watching my CTR is fine
because my thumbnails are good and my
titles are good so I've got that covered
and my engagement you'll notice I call
to action in like many different videos
and say hey time to like actually post a
comment or subscribe or whatever right
I'll do shout outs so I'll do like all
kinds of little games and stuff like
that
um but I don't do nearly as much as you
you can do you can like post a pen
comment you can make like two or three
calls to action you call it action on
different platforms you can do games
where it's like hey I will give the next
person that subscribes or like if I get
50 subscribers or 100 subscribe to this
video I'll give one of you X and then
you go back on social media later and
like you
um you know you uh talk about that so
those are the kind of things that like
you can kind of do uh if you really want
to like up your engagement
avd is just making good content and CTR
is just better thumbnails and and uh
better thumbnails and uh titles
so anyway I would think more about these
things like I would think 90 about these
things in 10 on stats like most people
the stats hold them back especially
smaller content creators the the
um smaller your channel is the the less
these stats matter because they're being
viewed through the lens of just the
small amount of subscribers that have
subscribed to you so it's not a very
good
it is really bad if you're below like 50
000 Subs to like pay attention to these
things because
they don't inform you like like there's
so many content creators they're like oh
I've got a 25 CTR I'm like killing it
and it's like no dude like you just have
five subscribers so if three people
click on it it's not a big deal same
with like avd like like if like you have
a core audience of like 100 people that
will watch anything you do and that's
the same people that like go to your
Twitch stream and watch every time
that's not a good indication that your
your content is good and so many people
they they get into this cycle where they
think that they're making great content
because these stats are really good but
in reality it's boring as [ __ ] like I'll
tell you
almost 99 of the time that I like
consult someone or I go to a small
creators Channel like your content's
just [ __ ] boring it it it's
exhausting to watch it sucks like um
it's not providing value and it's not
entertaining and that's because you're
not following these Trends and it's not
because like these stats are good or bad
so I would rather that people almost
forget about this [ __ ] entirely and like
focus on this stuff because this is what
the top people are doing they're
thinking about like how to make content
as an art form right more creatively and
like in a really interesting way
and like for me I do this too like right
like so like I said I don't focus on
this stuff like I I really focus on I
want to like make videos whether it's on
the patreon or on the main YouTube
channel that provide just an insane
amount of value they might be really
long they might be like boring to a huge
amount of people but like for the right
person this video should answer what
YouTube Discovery is about and like it
should give you actionable things that
you can take away from it and you should
go and be like okay I like completely
understand this and I know how to use it
same thing with like any of these videos
I I don't want people to understand that
there's a gambling problem on Twitch I
want people to understand everything
about that right like you will walk away
an expert in 50 minutes on what the
gambling situation is on Twitch and the
considerations on both sides that's my
goal right and that's interesting enough
that people will watch videos about it
enough people that I care about right
I'm cool with 50k people watching could
I have made this a 15 minute video with
the beats and pacing and gotten four
times the views yeah 100 right five
times the views of course but I want
that's just not my my personal goal
right so you have to like set up whether
you're an educator Entertainer or like
what's going on but either way like you
should be focusing on the things that
make like creative the things that are
like art the things that like make a
video engage and interesting or
incredibly valuable rather than like
focusing on these stats especially if
you're small but if you're a bigger
Creator and um
you can kind of use this stuff to inform
what's going on like for example um
I look at my average view percentage and
I see that like a lot of people drop off
in these videos after like the first
like minute or two
and what that tells me is I need better
intros A and B like the subset of the
audience that watches this kind of
content decides that they don't want a
super comprehensive experience and to
like really understand what's going on
they just want like you know guy to be
entertained they're like they're not
bought into like a 58 minute video about
the end of like how Esports works fine
right like that's okay
um I know that if I wanted to increase
that I have 50 of my audience after two
minutes right and then after that I have
like 30 of my audience almost to the end
so like what that tells you is like
um people decide they don't want like
really long form videos and that's
totally fine like I this is just how I
do things so
to some extent that's that helped me
understand something like that right
um but again that comes down to like the
type of content I create and like what
makes it interesting okay so that's how
YouTube works as of to 2022. and I think
it's how it's going to work going
forward probably
um because the single video system
is
really good to identify and serve on its
own there it's probably how YouTube
should work
by the way
um shorts videos work exactly the same
except they work on completion rate
which is how many times a person watches
the whole thing completion rate can be
higher than 100 so if you have like a
person that like if people watch a video
1.2 or 1.5 times on average so they play
it through six seconds and then they
play an additional three seconds right
that's a 1.5 because they play six
seconds 100 plus 50 percent
so if your completion rate's like 300 on
a video or whatever for like a short
um and your engagement's really high
like your shorts will do really well and
just like um anything else shorts are
all their own videos
um but they also sit in their own
carousel so that they actually don't
compete with YouTube videos at all it's
kind of good that I brought that up I
should have brought it up earlier so um
you can you can post a maximum of three
things on YouTube every day so that
could be like a community post and two
videos and then after that YouTube will
actually not serve
that content to your audience so like if
your fourth Community post nobody will
see it basically effectively nobody in a
24-hour period
but yeah shorts don't exist on that
Spectrum so you can post 50 shorts and I
have had this confirmed by YouTube you
can post like 50 shorts you can still do
your community post two videos whatever
doesn't follow that system deliberately
so that you can post a lot of shorts and
grow
for the vast majority of gaming creators
the absolute best thing they could do is
post shorts right now 100 highlights and
things like that get views now I don't
think those views really convert into
much but at scale that's good so just a
couple notes on shorts
and uh how they work basically they
exist on their totally owned Carousel so
yeah just post shorts and then follow
these rules for normal videos
um
and there's some concern that shorts
like mess up a channel
but they're going to be updating YouTube
really shortly
to have its own like short section so
that people can view videos like this
uh that that's the reason I haven't done
shorts yet but after that update I will
do them so you can still do them and not
a big deal all right that's it hope is
useful leave a comment if it was thanks
