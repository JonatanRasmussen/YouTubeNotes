hey okay we're talking in mastermind
chat and patreon about
this concept
of titling and seo as it relates to
youtube videos i'm gonna sell you i
think right now
on why i don't think that seo
and
optimizing things for search matters
going forward i think that it still
matters but i think that it's being
phased out of existence i'm trying to
explain why that is so what i i mean by
seo i mean search engine optimization
which is
the idea of
optimizing your content or your business
so that you
will search for things that people will
search for so for example like using
google adwords and you're selling a
product like
you gotta look around like you're
selling like water okay and you might
bid on a keyword that's like top bottled
water 2021 because you think that people
are going to search for that so the
caveat to this talk is that
in something like paid product so like
when you're thinking about like cpms
you're thinking about doing any kind of
like advertising with paid media in that
case uh keywords is gonna always matter
but i think that's the only place it's
gonna matter going forward what this
talk addresses is
marketing and any sort of like um work
that you might be putting in to
do seo for your websites or your
businesses or content creation okay so
the reason why i don't think
that this is gonna matter
is
because i think that um
well let's start with youtube it's
probably the easiest example to use
youtube i think increasingly
uh so like when youtube first started
you do something like this like
top
uh
five streaming
success
tips for growing streamers
okay like that's like a great title
old-fashioned um
right like it has streaming success tips
in the title which you know people are
searching for and you can do like
keyword research to figure out streaming
success trips or growing streamers
or i see now that i'm thinking about
this i'll do it even better for how to
grow a stream okay so this is like an
ultimate [ __ ] seo title right top
five streaming success tips that's
searchable how to grow a stream
absolutely searchable people are typing
into youtube how to grow a stream okay
and this title will still work like
especially if the content's good
it'll work well top five streaming
success tips for how to grow a stream is
good okay but this is old-fashioned
um
this video by the way caveat this is
like exactly what i want to put on
patreon it's so valuable i can never
talk about this on the main youtube
channel it's just not interesting enough
but oh my god like this is like bleeding
edge like only a few marketers like
really understand this like the amount
of value in this is gonna be crazy so
this is really old-fashioned that's how
like most people are still marketing but
like the the real way to market now uh
i'm gonna show you so like let's go to
like some really successful channels of
like people that are figuring this out
and why it works
so for example
here's
our boy
ludwig right and like let's look at
the type of
stuff that he's making and i'm also
going to show you another channel which
is 39 daff
and then we're going to talk about this
so 39 daft for example
for like a live streamer
is just absolutely overperforming on her
youtube why does force against my will
get a
get this kind of search volume like
because nobody's searching forced
against my will nobody's searching bro
please no more tomatoes okay
but this is a phenomenal title and i'll
tell you why in a minute for ludwig it's
the same thing ludwig has a little bit
of the traditional marketing that's
attached to his um videos but if you
look at his like really well performing
videos
i bet five thousand dollars my roommate
couldn't answer this nobody is searching
for this right and this and what i'm
purposefully taking out videos that are
over performing against his other videos
because
i don't want you to think that this is
just coming from a subscriber base i
challenge mr beast to a fifty thousand
dollar poker game right nobody's
searching for mr beast fifty thousand
poker game all right um let's look for
like really big over performers can i
beat the hardest game of all time in
under 30 minutes uh i made pokeman
pokemon pokemon force i have it i made
pokemon platinum impossibly hard 986 000
views okay let's look at another critter
before i start telling you what's going
on here
how about small ant
so small ant
is consistently over performing his
subscriber count in videos even though
his subscriber count is
1.75 million
and so he has 1.75 million but his video
he released three weeks ago has 4.2
million views see this one 1.4 2.5 1.6
1.5 2.3 so it's it's actually insane
when a youtube creator of this level of
subscribers is beating
their
number of subscribers and view counts
this is purely recommended and search
right because it couldn't be as
subscribers because he's getting like
two or three times the amount of people
on some of these so
mario odyssey but you lose one coin
every second game over at zero so
nobody's searching for that right uh it
is possible to beat pokemon x if
trainers are all level 100 nobody's
searching for that either but this is an
incredible combination of a title and
thumbnail um because the way that new
marketing works and here's like the big
drop like this is the equivalent like
we're at a club and you're waiting for
the drop for like 15 minutes and here it
is
it is that
new marketing
means
is directed
towards a person
[Music]
an individual's
direct interests uh aka
you structure your marketing
in a way that makes it most likely for
someone to click through
and watch
okay and that's like the entire purpose
of your thumbnail and title at this
point in like the meta
you're not
going for or like very little of my work
in like my youtube channel
is working towards
trying to get people to
you can see like i still have this habit
because i'm an old-fashioned copywriter
so
but but if you look at like my videos
like small streamer syndrome which
nobody searches for is one of my best
performing videos right but then you'll
see like something that's a little bit
more traditional
dr lupo's moved to youtube live which
would be something that people search
for because i can't help this but you'll
see that i'm changing my mind on these
things
logan paul teaches us networking
unmotivated streamers these are things
that people don't search for
um
and they're like videos that i might do
that have this kind of seo like
questions millionaires ask themselves
actually like this is a very heavily
underperforming video compared to other
ones
so
what i'm saying is 39 daft doesn't
market to the youtube algorithm
she markets to
a person who really wants to understand
bro please no more tomatoes i want to
click this video because i don't know
what the [ __ ] it's about and i i i have
no idea and it's a compilation of like
highlight clips but this is a hilarious
i think that
i think that daph
has the best titles in the business like
right now she has some of the best
titles in the business
obviously there's like other people you
can look at like logan who are
really stepping up if he still does
stuff on his youtube channel
he's so busy now
yeah he he doesn't
but he's got this figured out too like i
boxed four people at the same time is
not even though he has this massive
brand of 23 million subscribers he's not
using like logan paul and his titles he
doesn't have to he can say something
like goodbye forever dot dot
and like every part of that title is
like super intentional
i think you have to be on like another
wavelength of marketing to understand
this because this is this is what's
called experience based marketing and
it's like if you understand this you you
unlock like the key to the universe it's
the idea of
building an experience and a story and a
narrative um no matter how much i i i
this one video will not train you in
this no matter how much i
work on people um
in like my very close circles that i'm
trying to teach this they don't get it
like it's it's it's a mindset you have
to shift yourself it's like zen almost
you you have to be a part of like the
of this and understand that like when
you're marketing something and like i'm
using titles and thumbnails um as a
as a like
example but this applies to like every
type of business right like we can go
into businesses that are really well
marketed
like for example
um like they have like very good coffee
this is like a tea that i buy for
example
and
you can see that like
there's there's not
a focus
on
seo anymore it's
very direct copy
and very short
creative to tell a story this entire
thing tells a story
okay so in the same way
what logan paul is trying to do through
a video like goodbye forever is he's
trying to tell a story what is this
about is he leaving is he stopping
creating content oh i'm sorry you can't
see this because of how i have this set
up
where was that where did that video go
here
so
like what is this it's him looking in
the back of a car hd
and so you get the impression that he's
going somewhere that he's traveling he
might be moving he might be stopping
creating content what is this about so
why did that like what is this story
about
and
he
and then you just like the goodbye
forever the period like adds so much
authority right so this is a very
carefully constructed
video this is like every single detail
on this is like really specific to get
you to immediately be able to tell
what this is about i spent 150 thousand
dollars on this pokemon card why
right and then you thumb over and it's
him getting out of a private jet
so so like what happened here why did
you spend 150 000 on this cardboard
thing like why would you be so crazy to
do that right again like very simple
imagery small ant same thing every
single one of his
uh every single one of his things tells
a story is it possible to beat pokemon x
if trainers are all level 100 why did
this video perform so well because it's
asking a question to people in that
demographic and it's immediately
informing you of what the story is and
it's be getting the questions it's like
i don't know like is it like if you're a
person that has played pokemon x
and or even if you're not you might be
really interested in this and then you
you click the video and it's a 36 minute
video it's like a devon national level
video but like it's it's it's like
it works right it's like very high watch
time so
hollow knight but i keeps doing speedrun
skips apparently right like again is
telling a really interesting story and
apparently like adds so much value there
so
um i want to like move people away from
this idea of like making seo or keyword
oriented stuff like if you're a true
marketer
then
what you're saying um
like if you're a true marketer like you
i i think the
last decade has taught us that like we
need to
cater to algorithms because
we
[Music]
because the machine is like the great
determiner of like who
um
watches our content or watches our or
visits our business or buys our product
but now that is um
i'm gonna say some like crazy spiritual
[ __ ] so like the perception before was
that we need to cater to the algorithm
because the algorithm determines who
who our content or who our business is
delivered to
but now that is only true in like a
esoteric and spiritual sense it's only
true in like a literal truth type of
thing like yeah like there's an
algorithm that literally does that
but it's not true anymore from a
marketing standpoint
because the algorithm and the technology
has gotten so good
that it is now you the viewer and the
person that determines who receives that
content and that might be like you need
to like really sit back play this a few
times and think about what i just said
the algorithm is so good
and the system is so good that it is no
longer a system that needs to be gamed
the system works exactly as it's
intended to it will deliver content
directly to who wants that content in in
youtube's case right um and and if
you're using paid advertising so you
don't have to
work so hard anymore on like
advertising
yourself in like an seo or old-fashioned
keyword way because if you just tell an
interesting enough story then that work
gets done
and that's why bro
please no more tomatoes works because it
tells a really interesting story or her
praying here is like
why no more tomatoes i have to know
like how many of you have to go quick
this video because you just don't you're
never gonna i'm not gonna tell you why
there's no more tomatoes like you gotta
go
figure this out you know and it's the
truth with every single one of these
things where you can just make a video
like the truth but like if you don't
understand this concept of creative and
experience based marketing
then
this will seem entirely foreign to you
it'll be as if i'm explaining to you
what is the sound
like you understand the sound of two
hands clapping but what is the sound of
one hand
and that'll make no sense to you you'll
have to like sit with it and be like
what like
in the same way like what is what is the
what why does bro please know more
tomatoes work just really start thinking
about this concept i promise you that
like if you think about this concept
this will be like one of the most
important things that i've ever talked
to about in terms of like marketing okay
