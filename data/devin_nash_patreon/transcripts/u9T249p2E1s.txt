hello we're going to have a big talk
today about patreon updates and things
that are coming things that have
happened so for the longest time i have
been trying to build a newsletter i have
been trying to figure out how to do that
and i tossed the idea around the lab the
community that helps us out with all
kinds of projects just around the
discord server and everything and no
matter how i structured it i could not
figure out a way to create value like i
just couldn't do it and i think part of
the reason is because um
it's hard to to make a newsletter that
is actually worth paying for in this day
and age i think there's so much
information out there that you can't
really distill a lot of stuff into text
that is going to like really be worth
like a tier two or a tier three sub in
this case to like this patreon so how
we've set up this patreon has been um i
mean honestly i was just going to make
videos about business concepts that i
couldn't put on youtube because
people don't care right um and most
people aren't like really success
oriented they they kind of just want to
like care about what's happening with
like twitch drama and stuff so my main
youtube channel was not a place for that
i created a patreon so that i could put
those videos somewhere and that uh
people could like have an alternative to
subscribing to the twitch since we
didn't stream anymore and the patreon
went crazy like it's been so i didn't
plan actually to build out anything for
it because i figured you know it'd be
like 500 a month
uh or something and just a few people
that were interested in the videos it
turns out that we we get tons of
messages about all the videos and that
they've helped a lot of people build
businesses and um now i'm really
enjoying making them so i want to um
keep doing it and i want to keep doing
those those videos so nothing is going
to change about um the videos you always
just pay five dollars a month and you
will get all the videos uh that i create
and and there's i guess over 30 now and
i'll just keep making them make about
one or two a week and it's great the
last one was on community building
really enjoyed it and uh a lot of the
questions and the stuff that we do comes
from mastermind chat
which has been fantastic too so that
brings me to tier two and tier three
subs right now
there is not a ton of benefit to being a
tier two and tier three sub on patreon
um i mean the a lot of those subs would
disagree with me and they say like the
videos are worth it the mastermind chat
is worth it but i'm always trying to
provide value right i i really believe
in exponential value so i was like okay
well i need to deliver something that is
on a consistent basis that is going to
provide that level of value and for a
while i was thinking live streams but
the more that i
tool around with like live streaming
i just don't like it i i don't like the
format of like going back on twitch
and
going out into that audience
and just like dealing with that i just
don't like it um i feel like my
i feel like live streams uh the focus
live streams on certain subjects with
certain guests are great but um like a
sort of like back and forth show is like
not that great
i don't know i'm still thinking about
that but anyway that's that's not what's
going on so we need to provide more
value to tier two and two or three
people and um this is what we're going
to do so or or start of what we're gonna
do so coming up soon there's a sort of
unspoken rule but i will be making that
official but anybody that's in the
believer's tier which is a really
awesome tears people that want this
place to succeed and want me to keep
doing this um that you guys are awesome
uh free phone call
uh every six months about whatever you
want um i'll do no prep for it i do prep
for consulting but i will uh talk as
long as you want about whatever you want
and then we can talk so that's that's
one thing
business consulting advisory stuff
whatever you want and um
that's just a thank you for those people
there tier two and tier three are going
to get um drum roll
i don't know if you can hear that the
meta marketing report by devin nash
so the meta marketing report what's that
well how could we explain it
without using notepad
so
the devon nash metamarketing report
is going to be
every friday
you will get a video here on this
patreon and don't worry um there will
still be more more videos i mean i'm not
gonna stop creating any kind of content
uh for the five dollars here that
that'll just be
videos i want to talk about things i
can't just can't help but create those
videos but every friday um
so i i want to explain like the the
theme behind this this show before i
like fully announce it
i have noticed that
my job which is um
i work in a space where
i see things happen before other people
do i see that because i'm talking to in
the game industry and in the marketing
industry and there's two reasons for
that i'm talking to publishers and i'm
talking to brands and i'm talking to
them every day so every day i'm talking
to major major brands like um people
that you would the household names that
you would know that you buy from i talk
to those people obviously a lot of ndas
a lot of stuff like that um
but i speak to these people i speak to
many gaming publishing studios and i've
realized um
that i have forward knowledge of things
that
uh other people are actually just not
privy to like it's not even just like
so so
i could i could write about that but
like like literally for example um
was a good example like
i
know how well a game is going to perform
before it's going to do it or like i i
have information
that um
like well let's just like like for
example um like tick tock live right now
is the unequivocally best place
to
stream like you should stop your twitch
stream and you should go stream on tick
tock live wide out like that's it um
it's incredibly good so is reddit live
if you can get on it is unbelievably
good and these are like things that i
know
um
that i get privy to because like brands
are working in this space or like we're
running tests
and this is the information's not out
there like you can use it's very hard to
find it's confirmed by like a person
that's actually doing it
combined with um
a lot of things that i'm just paying
attention to
i'd like to keep people in on so the
meta marketing report is once a week i
sort of just like have a list of things
that i spit ball about what i'm
interested in where i think there are
hidden opportunities that people are not
talking about
how to take advantage of those
opportunities but also focusing down
topics of the week in a sort of
distilled format
where um i kind of explain out what
happens so
um kind of like a sort of tldr of what
you need to know about a lot of the
major week's happenings and for that
reason it's going to be on fridays
because we'll review the week and we'll
also talk about but there'll be like a
segment where i talk about some of the
things that i'm paying attention to
because every week i'm kind of thinking
about or paying attention to something
and um i i'm thinking very carefully
about it where i'm activating it in some
way so i might be talking about ppc ads
or i might be talking about um different
ways to to acquire customers i might be
talking about um sales strategy or
copywriting
it will be a all kinds of things
and i i think it'll just be really
great for people who are trying to
either build a
brand themselves or a content business
or um
particularly if you're owning a company
as that's the sort of sort of mindset
that i'm in much more
um is entrepreneurship i've just i just
realized that
the upside
of like owning things that um make you
money and and produce results is like so
much infinitely better as a lifestyle
and as a as a choice than um
like
being a uh like a concert i used to
think that like it's funny like how you
think about things in life this is like
a diversion thing this is like not a
very good announcement but this is what
you come here for right these kind of
like little
nuggets of small value hopefully
so i was thinking about this and it's
like when i started out as a as a
content creator in 2012
i was like man this is awesome like like
you don't have to work for anybody else
and you can like really um set your own
hours
and then i realized like okay well what
if i go like build a company
it's a lot more work but potentially you
can just like check out right like you
could be done in one sale that's pretty
cool too and then i and now
i've like been through this whole
process of doing those things and i
realized that
the the real
trick is to own cash producing assets
um
and then simultaneously work on
something that is exponentially
scalable that you're passionate about so
like for example
um i can scale this agency a lot
and i can
also own
cash creating assets um
like physical property or retail or
businesses
uh that that turn on themselves are
highly turnkey or manageable
and and earn from those and so there
will be some thoughts about that and and
some of the marketing around those
things particularly if you're very good
at advertising and marketing advertising
and marketing is like a blanket skill
that you can apply to any business you
could acquire a failing business or a
business that's not doing as well as it
should be i shouldn't say failing and
you could turn that around with superior
marketing knowledge like for example i
might pull what like you might pick up a
restaurant in a bad location
sorry a good location pick up a
restaurant in a good location
and that restaurant is just not doing
good sales well they don't have any like
google presence they don't like
understand seo or yelp or like reviews
or things like that um
you could run like one campaign on
instagram
where
you know for 500 bucks you dm
uh
30 local influencers
offer them a free meal and some money to
come in and post a report uh on their on
their instagram
and then immediately
like increase the foot traffic of that
restaurant by like 30 overnight right
and and just like you just run the
numbers on that
the owner thinks it's failing or maybe
they're getting out of the business
because they're like older these are
kind of things i'm thinking about so
you're getting kind of a mini meta
marketing report okay um so there'll be
some there's the things i'm thinking
about like that but also there will be
like obviously i'm in tech i'm in brand
um there's a lot of stuff that we're
doing um that should be
uh
good and relevant so um a lot of stuff i
just don't have time to do
that i'll talk about there that i i like
some of this stuff i really want to do
like a a review of like the yearly
reports from stream hatchet things like
that so that'll all be on there so the
matter of market report is opportunity
at that uh there might be some
livestreaming opportunities with it i
might live stream some uh the
metamarketing reports also
i am going to be joining a show soon of
a couple other people that we will be
doing a like report on kind of like live
streaming with some other authorities on
that subject too so there's a lot more
coming um just thanks to a lot of the
people that are supporting on patreon so
the metamarket report is a weekly
check-in for me to kind of like look at
the most important stuff that's going on
in the industry
really distill it down and uh try it as
much as possible to turn it into action
which you can use
to um
become more successful and and to
understand the space better than anybody
else which i i think is a enormous
advantage so that's um
my current solution for tier two and
tier three uh the unfortunate market
report will not be available to tier one
this is because um this is to replace
the newsletter that uh i was going to do
i think it's actually a much better
thing to do for the newsletter um if you
are tier one watching this and you're
supporting at that level fear not
because you'll still be getting um
weekly videos more than weekly videos
um i usually do at least one a week but
often times two or three uh that will
always be at the five dollar tier and
like um i i mean i just i sincerely
believe without like any kind of
pretentiousness that the videos produced
on there for the five bucks a month is
like so worth it like if you're gonna
subscribe for five bucks a month to a
twitch streamer or you can pay five
dollars to get like weekly business
videos from like
that i spend i spend time researching
and that are about subjects that like
i've had real experiential knowledge and
building those those aspects of those or
some of the things that i'm doing like
right now right um building those things
i think it's like really good and
luckily i'm really grateful that some
people agree with me here um so i don't
want to
make it seem like i'm taking away from
the people at the five dollar tier i
hope that doesn't seem like that it's
just that i really want to provide
something of true value to people that
are willing to go to tier two and tier
three um
because that that that is a huge
difference in support so hopefully
people understand um
there's nothing being taken away from
the the uh tier one it's still gonna be
awesome uh and i will still be putting
my best foot forward as far as my
business stuff there and obviously
you'll still be getting uh the videos on
youtube that that come out as well
um and uh live streams and everything
like that
maybe now that we have like a meta
marketing report type thing i could open
up a few of those to the tier one and
then basically everybody on patreon
could be a part of that uh instead of
tier two and tier three only so that's
it um i hope you like the announcement
leave comments what you think or if you
have ideas for the show the next or
first meta marketing report will be on
friday i'm doing a lot of business
traveling right now looking at office
space so i'm um that's why some of the
content has been a little bit light both
on youtube and on patreon i've literally
been traveling like non-stop it's like
horrible uh so
i'm doing my one last trip to las vegas
uh tomorrow morning and then uh i'll be
back for the next week and we should be
kicking then so uh lastly and most
importantly i just want to put out so
much thanks to
the uh everybody here that's listening
to this i mean it's been
phenomenal um
the support from this patreon and and
it's allowed us to open us to do up to
do so many cool things so i just really
appreciate it and i hope the metabarking
report is a new cool thing um that will
really help you out and uh just really
appreciate the value that you guys want
to provide in terms of support
in the post twitch era for us so thank
you so much appreciate it and talk again
soon bye
