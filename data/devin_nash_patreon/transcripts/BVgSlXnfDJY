okay hello i got a question from my
buddy and i was gonna type it out to him
but i decided that uh i just wanted to
talk because i
messed up my keyboard now i use an
ergonomic keyboard now i'm using this
one
and it just it sucks
it's horrible i gotta get an ergonomic
keyboard if you have any recommendations
let me know uh but that's not the topic
of this video the topic of this video is
this question hello friend i have a
question for you i have a member of my
team who is otherwise great but really
struggles with personal organization and
time management skills i think if i
could give them some guidance they could
really excel but i'm struggling to give
much advice do you have or know of any
resources for how to teach someone to
make their own system of personal
organization
so um i have spent a lot of time
thinking about time
management and i spent a good deal of
time thinking about organization and i
have i i think hopefully a lot of useful
tools to be able to help out with this
so first uh and foremost i'm gonna give
you a couple of books
so the books are kind of like the easy
answer and then we'll get into the more
the cool stuff books are the effective
executive uh by peter drucker
i think that every single person should
read this book um just flat out that is
involved in business or will ever make
money in their life uh i have a copy of
it on my
on my uh
here
literally how much i value this book is
um the effect of executive i i think it
is an absolutely awesome book i've read
it multiple multiple times i think it's
really really good so it's the first one
i would recommend um it has a and the
subtitle here you might have missed is
the definitive guide to getting the
right things done so that is a really
good one the second one i'd recommend is
high output management
fewer people know about this book i
think it's by grover andrew grover let
me check
yeah andrew grover this is another one
of those books that's really really good
for time management um and you might not
think that like management skills are
one-to-one with um time management
organization but it turns out they are
literally one-to-one with time
management organization so this is
another good book so starting there and
reading those two are really good and
then i'm gonna
give out a couple things that i think
are really good um
so
one that i've actually used i i've kind
of like been a part of like a bunch of
memes
um meme ones but the one that i really
like
for uh techniques some people say like
well you could do like pomodoro like 20
minutes on 60 minutes off i haven't like
found that that's very useful the thing
that i do think is useful is in list
format using what's called the
eisenhower decision matrix
which i i think is another kind of
popular concept and it's a it's sort of
a four-part
square series where you have urgent and
important
you have
important you know important urgent you
have not urgent but important you have
not important urgent and you have not
important or not urgent so i don't like
this um i don't like this one i like
this one yeah that one was dumb
important and urgent obviously you do it
now um not urgent or important you can
you should schedule um
not important or urgent you should
delegate and uh not urgent are not
important is to delete it so a lot of
people know about the system matrix but
fewer do not know how to use it um how
to use it is you actually write out four
categories
and uh based on your task list
and
if you're i'm going to talk to you
because you're an employer um and you're
working with an employee for for those
of you that are listening that would
want to do this for yourselves you just
kind of have to be your own boss but
this is i'm going to talk about this
from a leadership perspective so
if you want to have your employer
employee do this
i think the first thing you should do is
you should come up we're going to start
from the beginning
i think you should come up with
um
solid objective
co-agreed upon
goals
that
um appear on a monthly
three-month
and and possibly six-month basis and i
would never go further than that because
i i don't think that you can really plan
much in business for like a year or like
two years or three years i also don't
think it makes a lot of sense to give an
employee like a like a one-year plan or
to give yourself one so just keep in
mind like one i'm gonna be talking again
like an employer but everything i say is
applicable to yourself
so you might want to have like a general
direction of where you're going so like
for example with like novo or the agency
it's like okay i'm eventually going to
sell the company we're building turnkey
solutions to make it easier to replace
matt and i like when we exit um i have
those general thoughts right but my my
direct to do's are
very very immediate short term and i
have no plans whatsoever outside of six
months and even that's like really long
for me so i think having your
staff understand
on a one
certainly a one month and certainly on a
three month basis
um
what they should be doing and have that
be agreed upon um is a system called
kpis which are key performance
indicators
and is a really good way to get started
with organization and personal
organization because once you know what
you're targeting it's way easier to go
for it so if you know your key
performance indicators for the month
then what you should do what you ought
to do is you should meet with that
person on how they're organizing and
managing those uh those goals every week
and and i have a thing i call
one-on-ones uh and of course if you're
not an employer then do this to yourself
where each a week you go over a series
of questions and i will share a couple
of questions with you uh that i ask a
lot of my staff that might help you
um but in general we're going to be
looking for
questions that
are what i call power questions which
will kind of get you closer
and maybe inform you more of
uh what's going on so i have a couple
i'll share
um here
and then hopefully these will be useful
i was going to put them in the paint
so number one is uh how is everything
going uh how did its last two to five
core goals from last week go i don't
know why i say two to five because i
think two to five is probably too many
uh what are the challenges you're coming
across this week what can i do to help
um
what are top activities taking most of
your time this is a fantastic question
to to ask somebody um and i'm just going
to kind of highlight this question real
quick before i even go on because i
think um
this question is at the crux of your
problem
what are the top activities taking most
of your time and i'm going to tell a
story of a previous company that i ran i
had a staff member who was legit working
himself to death
he was working 16 hours a day he was
stressed all the time he was taking it
out of other employees and team members
and it was a difficult situation he
would complain to me about how much work
he had to do but when i actually looked
at his output it was the weirdest thing
because he literally didn't do it
was it was like was so weird um
when you actually like put down on paper
what the day-to-day was
there wasn't anything being output and
it drove me crazy i was like how can
this person be claiming that they work
16 hours a day but they just don't have
anything there's nothing actually gets
done right i talk a lot about like um
things that physically exist in the
universe versus like like busy work most
people just do busy work well it turns
out that like i actually and this is
sort of the extreme you can go to with
this question
i actually had him
he volunteered but i suggested it
uh to
write down every hour um in an excel
sheet so one block one hour just put on
one column you put
9 a.m 10 a.m 11 12 1 2 all the way down
and then you put the activity and then
you put how long it took
and
just had them do it you know like
there's there's just that level of
transparency is going to clear up any
personal organization or time management
issues and i have done this myself like
i call it a time audit probably two or
three times in my life and that's all
you need you do it for a few weeks and
you'll know exactly where you're
spending your time and then you kind of
get a knack for it so
i uh
i had him do this
and uh lo and behold like he was doing
 all um he'd spend like three hours
fixing a chair um he spent like a huge
amount of time like swimming or like um
being on phone calls with people it's
like a really good like you know just
typical ways that employees use to
waste time and people use
and um
like quickly realized that you know he
was completely ineffective anyway he
couldn't solve this problem we ended up
firing him but at least we had that
transparency into what he was doing so
this is a really good question you can
ask people for personal organization um
it's probably that they're just focusing
on tasks in the eisenhower matrix that
are just not relevant or not helpful um
some other questions that i think you
could you could ask are
uh
what are you trying to accomplish
like um
what are your goals
and then
the important thing being a leader of
yourself for others is to meet with that
person every week
and check
what
how they're progressing towards those
goals because
um you can't like have the talk with
somebody and say hey your personal
organization is bad your time management
is bad um you need to get better at that
you have to progressively fix it over a
week to week basis but but by measuring
results and and making their time more
meaningful and then you have to invest
them in the education which is why i i
think uh
at nova we have a policy where um you
can buy a free book a week through the
company we just give you a book
whatever you want it could be fiction or
whatever but um we obviously encourage
like i have a huge like list of like
self-improvement books that i'll
recommend people based on topic and
lately i've considered putting together
like a master list
that that just it kind of exists um of a
lot of like the personal development
books that i recommend but like
recommending these two books and having
them invest in the education is um super
good
so i i like that a lot um
and then i i think just like kind of
keeping the communication up and and
sort of asking like there's a lot of
really good challenge questions you can
ask like you can ask a question like um
how long do you think that'll take oh i
think it'll take about six weeks okay
what would you have to do to make it
done in one week what kind of team would
you need like what kind of people would
you need right just get them thinking
about that um but logging time is a
phenomenal way
just overall to kind of figure out like
how people are spending their time
because if you're going to fix a problem
you have to first be aware of the
problem and let me see if i i missed
anything
um
so you mentioned
he mentions he's struggling to give much
good advice so um
i
i think you're struggling to give good
advice because i wouldn't approach this
from you're approaching it from the
standpoint that you would give advice
the education investment that they
should have into like books is like the
end of your advice and then from there
on you're a leader slash guide who
evaluates your dr on a weekly basis
um your direct report on a weekly basis
and evaluates them towards their goals
and then communicates and listens um
to
uh the the results basically right like
like um
what they tell you you become reactive
and also i think investing them in the
goals like if you have like a product
you want to launch and you know
particularly like in product based
businesses
you kind of like know launch windows or
you know when things are going to be
it's it's much easier to kind of
organize and both get yourself on the on
the same page but um the last important
concept i talk to talk about is buy-in
so so having
that person bought in and understood
like they've read back to you they can
communicate every week effectively what
their goal is um and they understand
that in the context of their position is
super duper important and i think that
would be the last thing i would say it's
like you've got to get as much buy-in as
possible and i also include like
emotional buying and that like here's
why this matters like here's why this is
important
um and and if a member of your team like
doesn't feel like something is important
then you have like a bigger spiritual
problem right that you have to address
but if they feel like it's important and
you've armed them with the skills to do
it and you're on a weekly basis with
them
and uh it still doesn't work then i
think you go to logging time and if
logging time doesn't work slash you're
now several weeks into this process
you've probably issued a warning and uh
you said like this really has to
clean up you fire them right and and you
don't be shy about that because you've
put the steps into place to assure that
you were doing everything you can um so
i i think that's sort of the
step-by-step decision making
uh staircase that you make
with with the highest rung bean you let
them go and
and then um you'll want to do that when
you're confident that you've invested as
much possible
in their education and and their ability
to do this right but some people just
don't make it and and this isn't and
like the transparency that i've that
i've structured in this kind of talk is
like kind of a hopefully a good way to
sort of measure if or if not that person
uh can make it
oftentimes they won't when i
i'd say like 90 of the time that i get
the feeling i should fire somebody um
i uh
i i i'm right
or maybe 99 of the time so this is the
sun in the context this question is a
totally different thing right like like
i'm just saying uh that's the end right
that's the end of where you go but um
if you fire someone just remember it's
your fault right um and you can't fire
yourself for those of you listening who
are self-employed um
if you fire someone's your fault because
either uh you could go all the way back
to the fact that you hired that person
in the first place but beyond along the
way you could have like invested in
their buy and done more right um
so there's some self-evaluation there as
well but anyway um that's what i
recommend i i think these are kind of
really really great time management
techniques that have pretty much uh
gotten me to the point where like i can
pretty effectively work on like
four to six hours a day and kind of get
anything i want to do done there's um
and most that's just because of back end
organization so hope this helps okay
bye
