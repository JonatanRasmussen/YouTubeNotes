hey hey let's talk about free versus
paid marketing funnels
okay first of all what is a funnel
a funnel is this
ice cream cone it's kind of too big
it can be smaller
i'll do this this way
okay
that's a funnel thanks for coming to my
talk no i'm kidding okay so
free versus paid uh funnels okay
free funnel
this is a core marketing concept that
everybody needs to understand
basically no matter what
and probably a lot of the people that
are listening to this
already have some ideas so
i gotta provide more value than that
so um a free this can actually be the
same thing
but the idea is that
the
uh so so a customer comes in at this
point okay
so at the top of the funnel
so top of funnel resources
should always be very easy
for people to find like youtube ads or
advertising
um
what are some other ones word of mouth
right review sites
ins or social media
although i put social media last because
i think people over value social media i
think it's very saturated as a top of
wine funnel now um i think youtube is
probably the best
funnel that i can think of and then the
next one is advertising like paid ads i
think um there's just two
like you can still do it and you can
still drive people into free funnels via
like twitter and instagram
but it's so difficult to do because
there's just so many people competing
and so many people like that are trying
to beat the algorithm not just to like
make money but also for clout and
everything so you're just like competing
with the entire world to try to do it
so i don't like those sites so these are
like the top of funnel type of things
and um we'll put these in a circle
and
then we're gonna do
um
down here we're gonna do
like
bottom funnel stuff so this would be
like patreon
um that's for like content creators or
educators or entertainers
um
products course
service of some kind
and put those in another bubble
it could be like an etsy could be
anything like that
so
um
what you want to do is you want to
get people introduced to you
uh via the easiest means possible
and basically the lowest resistance
possible okay
so lowest resistance possible
is top of funnel
and then
bottom of funnel
is going to be
super high value
so
for a very long time
my top of funnel marketing
and um
this is not like this is a conscious
process but i'm not like thinking this
in
for for me specifically
um i'm thinking of it but i don't so i
don't primarily
use
my uh my own social media and my own
like brand as a means of like primary
income generation but i think this still
applies so just like keep that caveat
that uh i i will make some compromises
for example like i could be doing a lot
of different stuff like running paid ads
or things like that and i'll i'll make
some compromises because i don't view
devin nash the brand as a
primary form of income so
because of that um i may not have as
many top of funnel things as someone
else would need if it was primary so so
keep that that caveat in mind as i go
forward with this okay so
um
youtube for me is my top of funnel
marketing so i create
uh hopefully high value youtube videos
that drive new users
and for a long time the main cta so
that's a call to action the main call to
action was to twitch so and discord so
my two goals were to get people to watch
my twitch stream and to get people to
discord um thank god that i had the
discord goal because that ended up being
so much more valuable
at the end of the day i think
um and this is going to come as a
haunting thought basically all of the
marketing that i've ever done to drive
people to my twitch stream is
essentially
useless compared to
had i drawn uh had i done top of funnel
marketing to drive people
into
um
like like a patreon earlier or um
obviously a course though i have some
ethical concerns about that so i don't
do it but uh had i done that in the
beginning i would have had a a much more
um
a very successful
a very a very a very successful more
successful brand so
um
keep in mind that some of the free
funnel like top of funnel stuff can also
in of itself be rewarding so for and
you're going to see this like more and
more for example youtube
uh there are plenty of people that just
this is the funnel their youtube is both
a
means of self-discovery as well as a
paid
funnel as well it's not like so they can
be both too like you could use
advertising to drive people towards a
product and your advertising just is is
the thing that drives most of your your
revenue um you could use word of mouth
you could use review websites right and
you could get paid to post reviews on
those websites on twitter there's
increasingly increasingly you're seeing
on instagram and twitter that there are
monetization models um
that are coming up here that are more
popular so don't don't don't think that
just because these are free funnels free
meaning they're free to you to use and
the customer to consume that you can't
get paid for them you can so you should
be monetizing everywhere but um
like like this it's very very possible
to um monetize up here okay so the
concept is that for the devnet brand
using this as the analogy right um a
user goes to or user finds my videos
usually through recommended or something
and decides to subscribe so the
subscription is the first entry into the
funnel after after you've uh subscribed
you're here okay
and represented by that blue line
after you've subscribed and then um the
like teal line here will be at this
point you're watching quite a few of my
videos um you may be familiar with me by
kind of like my general concept so um at
the blue line here you'll see nothing
you know nothing about me
and at the teal line you'll know that i
am like a content creator that focuses
on like uh business and like lifestyle
stuff
and um that's good so
um what i'm doing through this entire
process
as i as i go down as i'm building trust
okay so
the the more time
that elapses
where there's a lot of value the more um
the more value i'm getting or giving to
that person and then at this level at
the green line um at this point um
you're very familiar
with the
stuff that i do and you may be even so
familiar that you're willing to support
it at some level okay so for me that
would be like a patreon but for example
one of the things i've always wanted to
do but i have ethic ethics concerns
about it is a business writing course i
think that i try to think of things like
okay what's like the most valuable thing
that i could like provide that i really
understand it's like business writing is
like so important but i have a lot of
ethical concerns against it but like
let's say that i did a course right at
this point maybe whatever that course
cost you'd be willing to buy it because
you've watched
10 to 15 of my videos you've consumed
some clips you've seen me on a podcast
or two and you know at that point that
i'm providing enough value so uh to you
that you would trust that that course
would provide value that i would be a
person of enough integrity that not just
sell you dog right and you would
know that if you put your money towards
that it would be worth it so um the
patreon model which is like what i've
switched to recently which is basically
the main way
that i
am going to be
monetizing paid funnels in the future is
just trusting people that they get a lot
of value out of patreon now um
a lot of patreons they don't necessarily
provide a lot of value with the patreon
themselves i plan to so i i'm making
videos that are um
like in of themselves valuable so
somebody might toss like 25 bucks just
for the free stuff that they get from
the youtube just to say hey i i really
love the kind of stuff that you're doing
and um
i i'm going to i'm going to put
something towards it right which is
great
but then i want them to get value on top
of that which would be amazing okay so
um but in the same exact way i could
also drive that a paid funnel towards um
like a product or course or service like
this is all like as long as you're
providing value but like the thing you
have to remember about your paid funnels
is your paid funnels always need to
provide um this is my internal metric
for the success is like 5 to 10x the
value
of whatever somebody is paying so if i
set a baseline of 5 then that needs to
provide 10 times the value of that in my
mind meaning like that needs to be worth
50 dollars to them this only pays 25
dollars you can see that needs to be 250
and so on and so on so this is hard to
do like um at some level you're
providing an enormous amount of value if
you're selling like a course for like
200 to 300 like that better be a
multi-mentor level course with like tons
of videos that better solve the problem
like one shot that they're they're
having otherwise you will um
people will like tolerate lower quality
stuff from you they'll tolerate rois
below this like like somebody gets like
twice their value out of it they might
feel pretty good but you want to like
really wow people if you sell like low
quality products then you're pushing
people back up the funnel and eventually
out of the funnel because eventually
what'll happen is like they'll lose
trust in you so they'll say okay um
the last like few and this like happens
all the time like in every kind of
business like let's say that you go to a
restaurant and you're like okay um i'll
have this food and you're like blown
away by you're like wow this is really
good and you go back and it's like
really good again and you're like oh my
god you're getting deeper deeper in this
funnel and now you're like recommending
this restaurant to your friends things
that let's say you go there and you have
a really bad experience well if you've
been there a few times you probably will
still go back or you might take it up
with like the waiters or things like
that but if you consistently have a bad
enough experience you will not go to
that place again and then you'll have a
worse
experience of that restaurant than you
would if you never went there at all
okay so this is an important marketing
concept which means like let's say that
you had three consecutive bad
experiences a place that you used to
like you're going to tell everybody how
bad that place was like yeah this place
used to be good went downhill right so
same thing right devin nash like his
youtube videos used to be fire i used to
get tons of value out of them um i like
i signed up for his patreon was really
good and like now he sells like courses
and if he's selling a bunch of twitter
dollar courses and i logged in and it
was two videos and it's just him like
slamming his head against the desk like
saying thank you for paying me 200 right
like like you would you would tell
everybody that okay and then like before
long your reputation would be um would
be completely tarnished right my
reputation should be completely
tarnished rightfully so because i
wouldn't be providing that value so be
very careful about your paid platforms
my patreon was years in the making right
like i really really had to think about
how i would provide value here before i
started doing it um i i think i over
correct so so like i i would encourage
but uh i would encourage people to be
less um
less anal about it than i am but still
like the the statement stands right so
um the the first lesson that you need to
know in like free versus paid funnels is
you need to create these funnels so so
you need to have an internal structure
in your mind of like
what
am i
uh do i have these funnels do these
exist so like so like draw this funnel
for yourself in your business and like
let's say you're running a retail
business or restaurant um okay what's
your top of funnel well it's walk-ins
right location and for a lot of
restaurants that's just the end of it
they just that's all they do and um a
lot of restaurants go out of business a
lot of businesses go out of business
it's just walk-ins right if you have an
incredible location then okay like that
could be enough and that's your that's
your entire business a lot of people
make plenty of money that way but you
can look at advertising you can look at
word of mouth you can look at review
websites you can look at events right
there you can look at social media
instagram instagram's like instagram is
a fantastic platform for retail
businesses for example because you can
pay
some uh incredibly low amount of money
sometimes the price of a free dinner
which costs you next to nothing just to
get somebody in the door and post on
their 100 to 200 user uh instagram
account but all 100 of those users are
people that are local and friends of
theirs right so um there's there's
enormous ways to market at top of funnel
uh that people don't think about and
every single business is vulnerable to
this even me like there's no business
i've ever found actually there's one the
only person i know on the internet that
is top of funnel perfectly um is gary
vaynerchuk and he has 12
team a team of 12 people working 24 7 to
syndicate his content to every possible
type of funnel platform he you can get
that guy is a madman right so nobody
should strive to be that good at it um
you should strive to have
uh a focused effort of like two to three
i'd say three maximum like free funnels
unless you're so sophisticated in your
business already that you know
to tell me that i'm wrong so so if
you're sitting here and saying i feel
like i should have more than that and
like you're putting up the revenue and
you and then you good good right then i
trust you but otherwise like if if
you're like i think for example novo the
the company has
one top of funnel right well two yeah
which is word of mouth which is really
important to agencies because we're and
that might seem like it's not very
powerful but after i have a rule with
every salesperson that we have in the
company whereas and this is an
incredible marketing rule where you say
okay
for
every
single person at the end of the client
relationship so if you've signed a
contract you've done a deal
number one how do we do number two is
there's someone else in the industry
that you can recommend would benefit
from this
and that has gotten us a ton of word of
mouth so top of funnel for novo is word
of mouth and number two is just straight
up youtube it's my brand which was
intentional was
marketing and giving information on
authority and content creation makes my
agency um an authority on content
creation by proxy and this is an idea
that gary vaynerchuk has done as well
for vaynermedia and to great success 900
million advertising firm and i um you
it's very hard to be an individual that
stands
uh uh in front of their business
um
as an authority and it's also very
dangerous because if you mess it up then
your business is gone too so um there's
a high risk high reward scenario there
but those are top of funnel um i don't
use like review websites or or you know
um any kind of like direct outreach
outbound sales type of things too to
like reach like influence through that
we do use outbound sales um
as uh so email would be top of funnel as
well for us i guess it's three that's
pretty recent anyway drop down into paid
funnels which is a service uh in our
case in my case it's patreon and
whatever else i like my newsletter or
whatever else i decided to do okay so
um once you understand this concept you
should have three free uh let's say
three free funnels i think and then i
would drop those down into one paid
funnel and i make those a ratio so six
to two three to one and um you can you
can
if you're if if some of those are
grossly outperforming so let's say that
like your free fun like youtube you have
like two to three million subscribers
you're
the the biggest vulnerability of most
content creators and youtubers is that
they're just not utilizing those users
in any way like they're getting ad
revenue from them sometimes only which
is crazy to me like anybody that is
above
10 000 subscribers uh should be thinking
very seriously about how to engage and
use those users and likewise in any kind
of business or anything like that you
should be thinking about that as well so
most people are um
super super gunshot on this and they're
just like
they're just like not engaging their
users this is like a key problem this is
like notorious also on twitch like oh my
god you have no data on your users at
all on twitch like if you have 500 000
to like one million followers on twitch
and the only way you can contact them is
through the start streaming button and
maybe discord like what are you doing
this is like this is like so so bad
right whereas you could really easily
create an email list with what something
to say that your moderators could do as
simple as like a top um five like best
plays list or whatever like that okay
there's like tons and tons of things you
could do like that so um
i could go on and on about like how
this thought process works like suffice
to say that the the thing to think about
here is just like how the creation of
this funnel
makes sense
and and how you like how you structure
this funnel so you should like get a
piece of paper draw this funnel for
yourself and then figure out what levels
of this you do have and then also you
should figure out how much trust or i
call it equity also do i need to build
so equity is a little bit different from
trust trust means like
i believe that this person is trying to
steer me in the right direction trust
can also be an entertainment value thing
right i'm not just speaking about
educational content trust can be i
trust this person to provide me a good
time every time i go to their broadcast
or every time i go to their business
right if you're an entertainer or i
trust this person to serve me good food
every time i go to their restaurant or i
trust this person to program good code
every time that i go use their service
or good consulting okay like all those
things apply so um
i trust is is that but equity is
something different like equity is like
a personal feeling that you have built
into somebody i believe in this person
enough that i want to invest in them or
i want to kick back and and throw their
support at some support back equity um
is very hard to build and i think it's
only built through authentic value i
think you can't um
you can't game the equity system nor
should you i think you should always
provide as much value as you possibly
can whether that value is like
infotainment or or entertainment or
whatever have you in content creation or
the actual product and service that you
have should be good so um think about
how much trust and how much equity is
built getting down this funnel and make
sure that like you're not putting your
product offering like up here okay
because on this line because if you put
it here what will have like your paid
offering
and and then you'll see people make this
mistake where they'll be like um
hey guys like before you watch my
youtube video like go buy my thing like
well i don't know you right like like i
haven't i haven't built that equity or
trust with you yet
so
you have not demonstrated yet that um
that that you're worthwhile way too many
people are putting their paid stuff like
way too soon and i always say that like
your first
ten thousand to fifty thousand
subscribers on youtube for example you
shouldn't think about maybe a hundred
thousand you should not think about paid
at all like like just collect money off
ads do your stuff add value um same with
like
every platform don't even think about it
all sure it's great if you get some ad
revenue don't think about monetizing it
just think about adding value
um
the vast majority of your first like
product or service offerings could be
free uh for review and just make sure
it's good and that people like really
like it before you offer it to the
public like this goes on and on for all
products and services
because if you put it top of funnel too
fast then you blow out your quality
remove any opportunity for trust and
equity and people won't buy from you
again um so it's really really important
to
think about like okay at what point am i
putting this like paid funnel because
like
nobody wants
a five viewer streamer to be shouting
for subscribers um that that like you
should never be talking about that and
like i i i never had a period of time
where i begged for subscribers it didn't
matter how big i got right like whether
i was at 5 000 viewers or 500 or 50
at no point in time that ever asked for
it and i was always taken care of
because i focused on value first so
um figure out how long it takes for
people to get down this funnel roughly
um and you don't need to have like
depending on like how data driven your
business is you don't need to have like
a very dedicated idea of that i have
like a general idea spiritual idea of it
in general and and um ultimately it
reflects on like how many people are
buying or or trusting your product or
service right
um
but yeah and in general you should have
an idea of like how long it takes to get
down this funnel with um
people
getting down to the bottom um just make
sure that that's like where an enormous
amount of value is like your absolute
best best stuff highest quality stuff
but um also don't skip on the
top funnel either right you gotta be
providing value there too so if it
sounds hard it's because it is um that's
why most businesses aren't successful
most people aren't successful but
thinking about this in this way and
strategizing i think can be helpful to
anybody cool so i hope this was helpful
see you again next time
