hello on our discord at discord.gg
devon we have a
channel called the mastermind chat it's
a patreon reward channel and it is a
poppin community of people who are
really impressive at business kind of
talking about things so occasionally
i will jump in there and try to find
something of value that i can provide
and
today i feel like it is
this so
chin z has asked the question um hi
working for a business versus working
for the business as a professional game
master i run games of dungeons and
dragons for sixty dollars a seat for one
shots and seventy dollars a seat for
custom campaigns i'm working fervently
on the business to develop product or
one-shot scenarios once i've achieved
mvp status on this product that's
minimum viable product i plan to shift
to marketing advertising to be able to
build a customer base in the meantime
i've been advertising custom campaigns
with the average price of fifteen
dollars to twenty dollars a seat and i
got no bites so i lowered the price to
sixty dollars and then to fifty dollars
the platform changed several things
including how reviews worked my
credibility on the site imploded so i
wrote it off and doubled down on what
i'm doing now and doing my own marketing
in past three days i've received three
inquiries about a campaign may make this
viable do i consider committing to a
campaign at a lower price for some
income or do i focus on a relaunch
so
people jump in on this and we find out
that what he
um
another person um
started saying
uh where is this
coffee he said um
that
uh
basically just did some math and kind of
explained how difficult it's going to be
from a service-based perspective um to
get to any kind of like realistic uh
economy
of scale here and
chenzi they responded that uh eventually
their end game is perhaps to
expand into getting other gms to do
games so
let me caveat
my answer here with my experience so i i
have helped
uh up until a certain point
the most the most prominent dungeon
master on twitch built a large part of
that empire and unfortunately
all of that was for naught so i can now
apply
that knowledge to this particular
problem at least
and we can start talking about how to
work on a business versus working in a
business
and then we can apply this across to
anybody that's kind of interested in
this from a products and services
perspective
um
okay so
there's a lot here
but i want to start by going over um
what i think
in something like dungeons and dragons
right which is
the the current service offered
in this business model so the business
model is dungeon dragons right
and like don't feel like just because
you don't understand dungeons and
dragons or whatever that you're going to
be left out of this video because this
is pretty much relevant to any business
owner the way that we're going to
explain this so current service offered
is a service that
has people play in your game
right and that's at dollars per seat
the max amount
of people in a d game
is six to eight and like eight is like
pushing it six is pushing it i think
like four is good so it's like four or
six but it's really like eight so even
assuming if you took like i like is like
work toward like work with like worst
case numbers
and if you charge like 60 let's just
tell you charge 100 a seat right one
game a week
and you get like 100 people 100 times
400 a week right times four is 1600 a
month times 12. it's like 19 200. so you
can start to see like okay that's one
campaign so like how many
of these are we gonna have to run to
like get to viability like how many
campaigns well we'd have to we'd have to
charge
if we charged a hundred dollars a seat
which we're not charging here we're
charging half of that but we're charging
like 100 a seat and we have four right
and we're making
about and we're running one per week
if we have four at
four hundred dollars
that gets uh we would need to probably
run i don't know what five more because
eight thousand so for like a viable
like for like a viable like 100k
you would need
about five active campaigns
which would give you like a potential
client base of
might be some overlap with players that
are playing the same roughly like
um
well what it's 20 players right
before per campaign
so that's doable you can you can
certainly run a service model based on
that
however i i want to
um pull this into
a
different way of thinking because i i
don't like
the service based model
for
this particular type of thing i i think
it's fine
um but you're going to limit your growth
on
the upper end like this is not a
business that can ever run it like a
million dollars a year right you could
potentially
you could potentially hire gms and then
through some kind of marketing convinced
dnd players that
your business is good enough that like
they should pay for the campaigns this
is very difficult to do without
some kind of previously credible
authority through social media so for
example
there's a dm the dms that i want to use
here um
are arcadem
and koibu
um
with the caveat that arcade has since
been uh canceled like i i'm going to
keep all that out of this but just
put
into the world the um
the kind of business model that we set
up for him versus koibu's model okay so
koibu's model is is the current model
that's listed
by chinzi in the discord it's a
pay-per-service model
and for what koibu does it works i think
he runs like four or five campaigns um
he charges a flat rate per person um
and he does okay he's a full-time
judging master has been for years he
also has a patreon that supports him
over here which earns him an additional
1 236 dollars as of the time of this
recording per month which gives you
benefits and such that you can see that
he runs one two three four five six
campaigns right now which is kind of
like his maximum
and then he has some additional upsells
and things like that so we can expect
someone like koibu to come out at you
know around like 100 to 150k per year
not bad it's a really great
career for most people and i have an
article times um a article
called a thousand true fans
that is made by kt rolster i think which
is a required reading for anybody uh
that's in business
a thousand true fans
and the point is like yeah if you had a
thousand people paying you a hundred
dollars a year that's
you know less than ten dollars a month
at that rate like eight dollars a month
you would be making 100k a year off just
a thousand people which is pretty great
right and our kid sorry coiba has like
far less than that and he's doing fine
at 150 000 a year charging per up
charging either he charges per episode
or he charges uh no he charges per
episode yeah that is how he does it i
remember because i've been in a couple
of his campaigns
now i want to use our km as an example
because arcadium was making upwards of
50 000 to 75 000 a month and he was
running about the same amount of
campaigns on average that koi boot was
but guess what he didn't charge for
campaigns
so that's crazy right nobody ever had to
pay a dime to play with arcade so what's
going on there well arcadium
uh and i would say
um arcadium built an empire right he
built a
brand and business
around the business of d d and that's
the
thing that i want to
exemplify today which is like
you can start a service you can have a
service
and your service could be
electrician
but
a business
is like sure like four to five
electricians working but also
uh paid
like paid regular checkups
of house or
uh upsells on
television
entertainment
product offerings you see what i mean so
dungeons and dragons is one of the most
incredible empire building um
businesses there is and that's actually
why we signed arkadem because there's so
many places you can go with it with a
unique world right source books
miniatures
in-game um
like world upsells like uh
lore or
um
art
or
merchandising
and a great example of people that have
monetized thunders and dragons extremely
well as critical role
right which only has one campaign but
uh makes
hundreds of thousands of dollars if not
millions of dollars right and one of the
things that all these people have in
common is that they have a separate
funnel
to introduce users into
their dungeons and dragons world which
in this case in both cases was twitch
and youtube
and that and then from there there's
almost like a following of users that
follow that stuff but even if you didn't
have that
and you simply just wanted to build a
business
off of dungeons and dragons without any
kind of acquisition at top of funnel
from social media
i would point you to
something like norse foundry which is a
company that we worked with where you
can shop for dice or i believe custom
miniatures yeah they do that we actually
had a bunch of deals
that were coming
for these custom miniatures that
unfortunately got canceled among so many
other things um when we found out what
happened so um
but i i'm like i'm sure like so this is
like a fantastic example of like an
upsell at a company that just i mean
they kill it they're doing so well
and they're they have no real like top
of media funnel they do some
sponsorships with people but the point
being that like if you have a custom
world or even if you don't like in the
case of
of these guys also another company that
we did work with uh was skull splitter
which is another dice company
and they sell like very high quality
metal dice dice is just one particular
avenue right there's like source books
rule books alternate worlds alternate
classes there's so many things that you
can sell within the dungeons and dragons
world you just like go to a kickstarter
and just look at how many things that
they can offer and it's unbelievable
boards cups uh like look at that skull
cup right there with um
with the dice in it that's sick like
playing boards like different rule books
there's just amazing amounts of things
you can do with the dungeons dragons
world and you may
um you may use the income that's coming
in from your dungeons and dragons
business
to
then support some kind of expansion into
like one product which you initially
sell to your verified user base
and then
you
might
um
[Music]
move from there into
use investing that money back into the
company and building out products that
are based in your world until your world
becomes a household name and so
i would i would encourage there's a
there's a place in seattle which is
where i live called mock sporting house
and mock sporting house is essentially
just like a huge tabletop store
which you'll see in basically any city
and they have everything from card games
to role playing games to miniatures
everything like that i love the
warhammer stuff
so you can go to game stores especially
independently owned game stores and
pitch these products right and put your
products in these game stores and start
those relationships that's a great
vertical because what i'm trying to get
people to think about is that there are
multiple different ways to approach
a business
and
um
i think
approaching a business purely from the
perspective that you want to acquire
customers in order to run dungeons and
dragons campaigns with them is a limited
view
the the maximum that you'll reach at
that point is like uh like a hundred
thousand dollars 150 thousand dollars
before expenses and that will be
unfortunately like
the limit because at that point like
you're trading your time for money
basically and what i would encourage
people to think about is how they can
expand their businesses in ways that um
they are no longer trading time for
money or that scale becomes
exponentially more in favor of the money
versus the time so a great example of
that is patreon for me right that i can
basically
deliver an enormous amount of value
actually let me talk about my transition
from youtube from twitch to youtube so
at this point within four to five months
it's looking like i'll earn
as much as i did
on twitch
as i will with youtube and patreon
combined
uh so so patreon and youtube will catch
up to what i earned on twitch so that's
cool right but here's the caveat
i'm doing it at about one tenth of the
time
so for me to achieve what i achieved on
twitch i was running a service basically
where i traded time for money
at the rate of four hours a day five
days a week and then there was also
podcasts and other things like that so i
spent a total amount of time live at
about 30
to 45
um let's see
35 45 minutes additional like podcasts
here and there so i'd say like probably
like 30 to 35 hours
of live time
every uh
every every week
and that's basically just under a
full-time job or it is a full-time job
like in america 30-30 hours a week
so i traded that for what i think on
youtube in a general sense i work quite
a bit on it because i'm always thinking
about concepts but the actual like
filming and the actual like
the actual pull on my time
is whatever it takes these videos right
and these honestly the patreon videos
are just because i want to do them
because a lot of people i could just put
up my patreon and people would support
it by virtue of the youtube right but i
want you to get the value like real
value out of putting your money into
this especially y'all who are in the
masterminds and and like i'm
continuously finding ways to do that
so i put out these videos right these
videos that go don't go anywhere but to
the people that are here
the um
the this total like this talk right here
is
you know i don't know it's worth 15
minutes right now maybe it ends up being
20 or 25 or something i do these like
almost every day so that's 25 minutes
and then i script and do my other videos
it's called that an hour right and i do
that three times a week so
i've
what's happened is i've reduced my time
investment for the same amount of money
by a fifth
and
that's what you should think about doing
because your service is a straight time
for money you can't i mean you could
lower the length of those games but
that's like optimize you don't want to
do that like dungeon dragon's about
having fun with like some players right
like you want these people to have fun
so you don't want to sacrifice your
service
um
for
like like for optimization and you also
don't have the ability to like super
super duper up charge like the only
people in the world that could probably
do that is like matt mercer if he wanted
to like run a dungeon dragon game
there's people that pay thousands of
dollars for that because he's built that
equity but you have a ceiling there's a
ceiling for certain services on like
what you can charge
like a and actually that that was
something that they brought up chinzi
uh mentioned that they had tried
to
put
15 to 20 dollars a seat or they lowered
it down to 15 or 20 i'm just sorry i'm
just like reading this one sec
so they had lowered it down to 15 to 20
dollars a seat
from
[Music]
60 a seat
and like weren't getting a lot of bites
until this like three
the three type of thing so even assuming
you could get like yeah so
i i lowered the price to sixty dollars
then fifty dollars and i saw some
traction
the average price is fifteen to twenty
so you're trying to sell a premium
product in a market that's 15 to 20
right and you don't have the scalability
like like consulting for example
the upper limit to that is
15 000 20 000 an hour for like expert
consultants but you will never get there
even matt mercer can't charge those kind
of numbers so the scalability of a
service-based business like this and
this will apply to many of you that are
listening to this to try to apply it to
your own projects uh it'll be very
difficult
but if you start thinking about like at
a very bare minimum
can i create a world or a brand
or a forward-facing
content
like provide resources for other dms
etc
um
then from there create a patreon
or
can i approach
five game stores
with miniatures or x product from my
world and sell it
and then i figure out the math behind
that and i figure out that oh like i can
actually make
you know one thousand to two like one
thousand to two thousand extra dollars a
month
by
simply just like supplementing my income
in different ways
it's not really important like the
examples i'm giving because the entire
goal here is that i'm trying to like
structure
how this is built
and why people like arcadium or are able
to
make these just insane amounts of money
because they didn't build like at the
end of the day it's exactly the same as
this person is doing right it's exactly
the same the difference is that
he broadcasted it he
then up sold every possible angle of it
and he built a following around the
world and the brand and he individually
collaborated with all of those other
people who had those followings as well
to maximize
the
uh and that that would have been
assuming that
like all that stuff hadn't gone down
that would have been the most successful
d d empire probably ever in two to three
years
uh it's just so unfortunate this is one
of the reasons why i'm so torn up about
a totally separate topic but
just just because it just sucks so bad
because the potential that was so high
um and there were so many thousands of
people that are benefiting but i digress
the point being
that i i see
a potentially infinite upward momentum
what like you can always add products to
your business
and they can start by like really simple
stuff like you can just make them one by
one and sell them to players like at the
very least figure out the process of
making miniatures figure out how hard it
is and then upsell that to each one of
your players that comes into your camp
your campaigns
um
or maps or any number of things right
again it's not the examples that are
important it's how you think about the
business everybody should be thinking
about their business in terms of like
how do i trade
um
time value of money
in a way where i can maximize my money
and reduce my time
and if you start thinking about that
that's the answer
to this problem
um
because and then the second part of that
and what i'd leave you with is the idea
of scale so
once you've asked yourself that question
you ask yourself can i scale
something like it like
for me consulting is a really great
profession because i don't feel like
there's an upper limit realistically to
what i can charge so right now i i'm
comfortable charging 500 i think that
that's like
about where i
stop well like that's that's i provide
more value than 500
but i don't think i provide more value
than a thousand dollars yet i just don't
think i have like the resources behind
me at that point you need research teams
and things like that a lot of
consultants don't do that they'll show
up for a thousand dollars i'm pretty
sure i could get a few clients at that
rate but it's don't feel good doing this
it's an ethical thing but i know at like
some point you know that time value of
money could be five or ten thousand
dollars and um i'm comfortable growing
that vertical because i see that
potential but i would not be comfortable
with a with a similar vertical where i
thought the upper limit was something
like selling seats in the game where i
don't think that people would pay beyond
you know maybe at the absolute maximum
like
five hundred dollars a seat
um
for something like that be
unless that's like like you're for
famous dm or whatever
or someone that works at wizards or
something like that
okay so
working in the business versus on the
business time value money and how do you
scale hopefully these are helpful a lot
of rambling but yeah there you go okay
bye
