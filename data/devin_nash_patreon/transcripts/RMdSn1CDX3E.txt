okay i want to talk about something that
i think is way more important to the
conversation around business life
success and financial success and
doesn't get talked about as often as
things like techniques to become more
successful or make more money etc but
it's actually way more important we just
never talk about it because it's not as
popular and sexy to talk about this
question is inspired because of a
question on my patreon mastermind
discord which reads by dismodal which
reads do you plan on making a video or
have you thought about the mental strain
on people wanting to move from one stage
of success to the next i'm in the late
and early game but struggle to move to
mid game because i really don't know if
i should personally target in order to
do so i am like a dog seeing a thousand
squirrels but chasing each one gets me
nowhere so it's honestly taking a heavy
toll on mental health so what he's
referring to when he refers to the
stages
is a
graph that i made in a previous video
describing different levels of success
starting with the start we're not gonna
go over it here because you can watch
that video
and if you aren't a subscriber to
patreon for five dollars you can just
get in and watch that video but the gist
of it is here explaining these different
stages we're at the start you're trading
time for money and you kind of work
through stages
and you get to becoming a higher income
earner eventually you escape earning
income from a job and you go into
building your own financial success and
assets out so what he is saying is that
he's having a problem
where he's probably in the early game so
he's saying that he has some kind of
middle to high income earning job trying
to transition to a point where he can
save enough money to probably leave that
job but that it's an enormous mental
toll to do so uh to to increase those
stages until
increase your financial success at that
level okay so
we don't talk enough about
making
active decisions
around success
and setting goal points and i'm going to
tell you in this talk in a few minutes
one of the most important
things i think we need to define about
how to like actually become successful
and so stay tuned for that but making
active decisions around success and
setting goal points what do i mean so
the the first the first thing
you have to do
before you set out for anything
is to get real objective about what you
want to accomplish financially
and why
because you have to understand every
further level of financial success
is going to
impart larger hardship on your life
relationships
family
and personal
psyche
okay so let's break up an idea
around ceos and executives and people
that are
successful that many people don't
understand
i am a person who both experiences this
lifestyle as well as i meet
dozens if not hundreds of people that
are also high-functioning ceos and
executives or owned businesses
and the stereotype which i think comes
from like a middle income
sort of like lower income level because
people don't get exposed to these types
of people is that you've got your fat
rich ceo that doesn't know what's going
on
my i i've never met not in my life have
i ever met a person at the head of a
business that is functioning that way
i've they have always undergone an
enormous amount of sacrifice and
self-actualization to get there so it is
my belief that
not without exception there are probably
people that trust funded in or you know
they're always going to find exceptions
these worlds but the vast majority of
people to achieve greater levels of
financial success have had proportional
sacrifice to that level so you have to
decide if you want that level of
financial access uh success if you want
to do that sacrifice i'm going to talk a
little bit about that
the more financial success you have and
the more success you have in general the
more responsibility you're going to have
why what what is the fundamental rule
there because
if you are creating value
and creating value is how to make
financial success happen right you have
to create a product that people like or
create a service that people want or
need and then people will pay you to
have that service or product and then
you're thus creating value you can
create value in tons of ways and now in
the digital economy we can create value
in all kinds of ways you create value
without ever creating anything physical
right you can get paid for just talking
i get paid for talking and other things
but i get i also create a service which
people want and that actually is a good
example because the service that i
create through my agency is
proportionally
way higher value to others and so people
pay much more than they'll pay for me
talking but i still do both so
every level of finances can impart much
harder hardship on your life and the
reason for this is because as you create
this value and you create more and more
value people then
decide to trust you with more
responsibility your customers
people that are part of your
your your inner and outer circles all
start to believe in you more and so they
trust you with more responsibility
things come into your life that take on
more responsibility and this becomes a
fundamental rule because as a person of
value
the more you you move up in the value
that you provide the more that you are
uh trusted and really responsible for
solving a lot of the world's problems
because most people don't want to solve
the world's problems so this is why you
see a lot of people at the heads of
major corporations like uh
trying to make significant changes in
things like climate change or hunger or
large problems that the world has in a
way these are sort of the only people
that ought to make that that can make
those changes right like
not only just because of their actual
accessibility and and the funds that
they have but also just because of the
reality that the vast majority of people
just don't want to do that they they
want to think about those problems or
talk about them on twitter with thoughts
and prayers but they don't want to
actually do anything about it they don't
want to buy nine percent of twitter and
actually join the board and actually do
something about it right or they can't
they just don't have the accessibility
or haven't built the the value to
actually create that opportunity for
themselves right that's fine that that's
all different sort of things this isn't
a video about judging those people it
isn't a video about judging anybody it's
just a video about you personally
deciding what you want to accomplish in
your life and then understanding the
cost of that that's where all this
begins and then we're going to get into
actually how to do it but you have to
understand that like at a hundred
thousand dollars a year
in in usd right
uh
i think this is achievable by the vast
majority of people and i actually think
in the digital economy it's gonna be a
little bit of a hot take but in the
digital economy this is achievable for
very low amounts of work i'm talking
maybe four to six hours a day
at the point we are at in the digital
economy if you learn the skills to build
resources like information products or
flipping products or selling a service
or selling a product you can
with automation you can remove a lot of
the
work from that i would say
that
the content
side of my personal wife
has
it takes less than a few hours a day
and produces more than a hundred
thousand dollars in income now i have a
business that produces
much more
not not personal income for me but in
terms of revenue for the company and
that takes all my time but that's
because i've decided to sacrifice at a
higher level which we'll talk about in a
minute so you can get to a hundred
thousand dollars a year with not too
much sacrifice one of the examples i
like to
use with this
is
a thousand true fans which is if you
have a thousand people paying you a
hundred dollars
every year
right you've just made
a hundred thousand dollars
and that's pretty that's like a pretty
low amount of people that you you can
monetize to get to that point it's
pretty achievable so just figuring out
how to do that right whether it be
through like entertainment and again
there's just so many options
now where you see like
even esoteric things that were not
possible before like artists making
money off of spotify plays right there's
there's all kinds of ways to do this
some of which we explore and the kind of
content that i do
if you go to like two hundred thousand
dollars a year
uh it's a four hundred thousand dollars
a year
this is again achievable but sacrifice
plays a part here you're either gonna
have a pretty high paying fang job or
something that's going to take a lot of
your time and responsibility or you're
going to have a business or a service or
a product that's going to take a lot of
your time and responsibility
the lifestyle change from 200 000 to 400
000 a year compared to 100 000 a year is
pretty massive depending on your cost of
living
and this for the vast majority of people
the vast majority of people like 99.9 of
people is where i think that you ought
set your goal to end up now the original
question
which i'm going to post here real quick
just so you remember this is a video
about like mental barriers in business
is that this is a person that is
struggling to move from a high earning
income job to a place where they run
their own business or have more freedom
i think what we're doing here is we're
considering the income levels but really
we should be considering time because
each one of these
things is a greater time sacrifice and a
greater responsibility that you may not
want to impart on your own life so
um
i'm going to kind of like talk about
that a little bit more right
we're just just going to break down the
last category which is 1 million plus
this is per year right
at this point
you are
sacrificing most other things
slash
life revolves around
having the foundations
to build this kind of income
so what do i mean by that i mean you
might be taking a meditation class to
clear your mind so that you have more
executive focus you might be taking a
yoga class to get
better in your body so that you're
actually capable of like sustaining this
your family is making great sacrifices
like your your girlfriend or wife is
like doesn't see you
except on with certain times during the
weekend you need to be very deliberate
with your time you're sacrificing like
an enormous amount you will have
relationship problems if you're not
absolutely perfect right
these are this is a very very difficult
goal to achieve so back to what i was
just saying before i was jumping around
a little bit the vast majority of people
ending up at 200 000 to 400 thousand
dollars is incredibly successful and you
can not only with intelligent spending
live an incredible lifestyle even in the
united states on that kind of money but
you can also save for the future
especially if you're starting early
now i say that because the prevailing
mindset in the united states and in
first world countries is that somehow
two hundred thousand to four hundred
thousand dollars is like a low amount of
money but if you earn forty 000 in the
united states you are below the top one
percent you will not meet every one and
a hundred every 100 people that you meet
you will only meet like 0.5 half of a
human that is actually at that level of
income
so
you are in a really rare category and
and it's really important to understand
why you're in that category you're in
that category because you're willing to
make sacrifices that other people are
not willing to make so that sacrifice
doesn't just include on your personal
life and the cost of that it also it
also means that you are going to make
sacrifices on a skill-based level on a
learning based level that you are
willing to put your time into things
that could very much fail and will fail
and then recover from those failures
which all takes a mental toll and it's
difficult and mental hardship so you
have to
set your mind to a goal that is um
you're really sure you want to hit and
and be fully aware of the sacrifices
you're going to have to make in order to
get to that goal so i had the goal of
making 200 000 to 400 000 a year
initially when i tried to sell my first
company
and i more or less achieved that goal i
was actually happy there for a long
period of time until even fairly
recently i wanted to go bigger because
uh for for my own reasons for what it's
worth the ch and this actually kind of
comes to like the real important part
that i'm going to talk about in a few
minutes
the
i wanted to make a greater impact on the
world and i don't know how to do that
except through finance and when i say
impact i mean i want to solve some big
problems in the world uh particularly
around education that i or i want to
help solve them i i wouldn't be so
pretentious to say that i can't solve
them but i want to help solve them okay
so that leads to um the kind of second
part of this so
if you have decided
and understand the level of sacrifice
you're going to make
you have to then disillusion yourself
from all the social identity that's
coming from twitter that's coming from
entrepreneur lifestyle or entrepreneur
lifestyle and realize that the vast
majority of people that are crawling at
you for success or talking about success
are not themselves successful they can't
be because if they were then they
wouldn't be part of the point zero five
percent we we know objectively that
point five in every 100 humans is going
to be at 4k a year this is the u.s right
this is like not even other countries so
the number of people that you're going
to run into they're making 40 000 a year
is unbelievably small so all these
people that are talking about this on
twitter and instagram and living this
like supposed lifestyle are not actually
right they're in debt they're miserable
the successful people that are in your
life that you manage to like get in
front of are probably going to tell you
a message that's similar to mine because
they are cognizant of the sacrifice that
you that you have to make to get to this
level and and very aware that you you
you ought not to one of my favorite
videos
ever is a video from elon when he's
asked i'm not sure if i'm gonna be able
to find this
elon musk
is talked
okay so this really is like a hilarious
video you can watch this it's right here
so this guy is like touring uh factory
for some kids
and the kids ask him like what is it
like to start a business
i think it's it's it's very difficult i
think i need to increase the volume here
i just want you to listen to this real
quick just kind of get an idea of what
i'm talking about from like real
successful people and how they talk
about this
difficult to
start companies and quite painful
i think that's important to bear in mind
i don't know if that's that's probably
not encouraging um
but
uh
i mean there's a friend of mine who's
got a good praise for
doing a startup it's like it's it's like
eating glass and staring in for your
best
um
so it's
if you if you're going to expecting this
it's going to be just fun uh you will be
disappointed
so if you listen to actual successful
people talk about this this is what you
see you you so
you like we're in our head so much with
these like folks from instagram
i love how this like this teacher is
just like looking at his life like holy
like this is not the answer i expect
rick i guess like and again that's
because like again
people that
are not operating at that level or near
it have no concept of this
you're you're inundated by twitter
messages by long threads from people on
startups by all of this like supposed
progress not realizing that to even
achieve a moderate level of wealth and
get out of debt is massively successful
and so you've set your expectations so
high for your own success that is
statistically all improbable or
impossible to achieve that of course you
are under great mental strain when
you're trying to cross through these
categories and instead of reaching out
for things in life that are important
like getting more time like having more
meaningful relationships like
self-improvement like getting your head
together about things you are chasing
these imaginary goals literally
imaginary these numbers are imaginary
zeros and ones and banks accounts right
that
you are chasing in order to get to
something that the people that are
telling you you ought get to that are
not even at themselves that is your life
right so of course you're [ __ ]
stressed because you have
you you have no you have no way out of
this uh prison that you've built for
yourself whereas the real successful
people are telling you what mind your
time be aware that they're a sacrifice
in this kind of level of success this is
something that they gave their own life
up for to do 100
right um that's the real message so if
you actually become
clear on that then you may realize that
you have a lot of different gears to
turn in your life that are not like oh
my god i need to be like a bazillionaire
entrepreneur
and
that is the modus operandi that i've
chosen to operate with consciously being
completely aware especially now of the
sacrifice that that entails i've
and the the outcomes that have happened
in my life from that are
many failed relationships
very few friends
several
heart like hardships nights at 4 am in
the office walking back for back home
numerous times right like i can go on
and on and on about that and
it's not
amazing and fulfilling in this dream
lifestyle like it's really hard so
so
that's the first thing to keep in mind
is like like just to understand your
stress at like a really
mental level about trying to move
through these sections and that maybe
you might want to re-prioritize your
focus into
[ __ ] like maybe i don't need 1 million
dollars a year to be happy because i
look at all these people that have one
million dollars a year and i don't have
really objective examples of those
people being happy you look at people
like will smith who is an unbelievably
successful and famous person who is
quivering in his chair at a mention of a
mild joke about his wife these are not
happy people like we see this over and
over you know this intuitively i don't
have to tell you this right you know
this you know this you know that most
celebrities and most millionaires and
people like that are not happy they talk
about their problems all the time and
they and so money and fame do not fix
these things we know this we know this
psychologically through the apa showing
that greater than 75 000 a year doesn't
meaningfully increase happiness we know
this in
in news we but how many times do you
have to be told that these fanciful
ideas are not going to bring you what
you want they're not going to relieve
your mental stress and more financial
stuff is not going to solve your
problems so what will i'm going to tell
you what will now and this is the second
part of this
i think one of the most
common issues
that people have
is they focus on
these income goals and numbers
but not actually solving a real problem
in the world
so if you are trying to move
from
a early starter like i earn 50 000 a
year i want to earn 250 000 a year or
whatever the hell the number is
you
don't need to do anything besides solve
like figure out what problem you want to
solve and the scale of the problem that
you solve
will be
proportional to the amount of income you
make it's the most important thing that
someone is going to tell you about
success
i so much so that i will repeat what i
just said and explain it
so if you decide to focus on large
problems that create large amounts of
value there will be large incentives in
terms of income and success attached to
those problems if you focus on smaller
problems which are more local then you
will
have a proportional amount of success
that you can still have great success so
for example if the problem that you want
to solve is
there are not enough there's not enough
quality mexican food in my area and you
start a restaurant
when you solve that problem you will be
rewarded proportional to the scale of
that problem there are no bad problems
and there are no
pro and problems are equal at least as
far as i'm concerned in terms of their
solutions so if you say
this community doesn't have access to
enough healthy food and then you decide
to solve that problem
that could be a problem that might have
a
several million dollars at the end of it
proportional to its value cool right if
you try to solve a global problem like
americans or a national problem like
americans don't have enough shopping
options for x right then you might build
amazon and now you've got a trillion
dollar solution so the problem that you
set out to fix
and i and it's my belief that
both on a spiritual and a financial
level
every human being should set out to
solve a problem
because
we lack a lot of purpose and direction
in our life
and going for a number
will not feel
to you when you hit that number like
achievement that is making you happy
but what will feel like that is if you
can
empirically see how you've helped solve
a problem
and then ideally see the results of that
so in a film
in a philanthropic sense
if you invest into
something simple like feeding a
community
and you see
the people eating
as a result of something you've created
that is infinitely more value to you as
a human being and will stay with you as
a memory than the deposit into your bank
account as a result of doing anything
else
and that's you don't have to it's not
such a romantic idea that you have to
like feed hungry families it's a really
easy allegory but you could do other
things you could like at the same exact
ways like if you have a grocery store
like a physical place where people are
buying things and you you can go to it
and it exists again infinitely more
rewarding and we can go down to like
even uh like a smaller level it doesn't
have to be that dramatic again like
there are different levels right
requiring different levels of sacrifice
you could build a desk
for somebody and you know that somebody
is using that desk right now or you
could build a chair and somebody's
sitting in that chair and maybe you want
to build that chair as perfectly as that
chair can be built
that's rewarding in a different way than
seeing numbers on a screen so what has
happened in
society now is we've divorced ourselves
from this idea of
like really creating
something because everything is so
vague and digital that
when you you don't directly see the
value that you create so even for
someone like me where i do these kinds
of videos i don't have a really good
idea of like who sees them or like what
kind of value it it provides i i can
read comments and and see the number of
views on a video but i don't really
understand the impact that it's making
on a person's like like life like that's
that's happening because i'm removed
from the process of actually creating
something but if i created things
locally and saw people using them
there's a guy in lake tahoe and a place
i used to live
he built these bears
uh he would like he'd like carve them
some of them were big they're like four
or five feet tall they're like wooden
bears take a tree carve the bear really
elaborate bears
i just loved his life because he would
go he'd go place these bears at
restaurants and give them to people and
you drive all around you see these
little bears
that he made
i i think
there's so much fulfillment in that
because like you're physically connected
to the thing that you're creating you're
physically connected to the problem
you're solving which again see like
problems don't have to be romantic like
oh we gotta feed hungry families or
whatever that's really noble and great
but it could be i know there's not
enough bears not enough wooden bears
around we gotta build more right
whatever problem you want to solve so
you have to set out if you want to
really be mentally stable and fulfilled
you have to set out by saying what
problem do i really want to solve what
am i passionate about
and
if you want to know how to find that
problem to solve
well that should be really easy right
you already consume
tons and tons of negative information
per day i don't think anybody watching
this video needs a guided tutorial by
devin nash on how to find negative stuff
to listen to right there should be no
end to it
okay
there should be absolutely no into it so
why not pick out one of those problems
and decide that you want to solve it and
decide that instead of being this adhd
mess that is
listening to 100 things a day which we
all are that you are going to focus and
solve one single problem and then if you
feel
like which is like a fulfillment thing
in yourself that you solved that problem
then you can solve the next problem and
maybe that problem that you solve number
second problem is the a bigger problem
and then by the time you're on your
fourth or fifth problem maybe you're
solving something uh of great
significance to you and your community
and the people
maybe even nationally or globally at a
level and i think if every human being
thought like that
instead of
shooting for these revenue goals that
don't mean anything
we would all be a lot happier and i
think the dude that asked this question
originally is running into that problem
where there's 500 different things to do
and you know i ought be a content
creator well i gotta post on twitter
also well i should probably
help my mom and oh i gotta do some
grocery store stuff and i really gotta
work out like all this stuff right like
just focus on solving a problem so
why did i get into esports
i got into esports because i wanted to
solve the problem
that players
were
really not
a couple of things players were not
really
um
how do i say this like
physically mentally and spiritually
taken care of it's basically like you
just put them in a chair and they play
videos for 12 hours and hopefully
they're good enough that they can win
like a league legends tournament and
nowadays like we like that's like we
have support staff we have like
um we have like visualization seminars
and meditation all kinds of stuff
changed in that it really i feel like
that problem is is largely solved and
for that reason and others i left
esports so now in the agency world when
i when i started novo i started this
because i'm really tired of all the
predatory business practices
um in
the agency world i really hate that
agencies abuse influencers
and influencers abuse brands by bad call
to action
and i think that that sucks and that
somebody should mediate that process and
make it better so i decided to do that
uh i'd never have any revenue goals i
wasn't like wow starting agency is going
to make me millions of dollars i don't
care like
no more than i said going into the
esports could make me billions of
dollars no more than i said in 2012 when
i started broadcasting that broadcast
could make two million millions of
dollars right i started you know why i
started broadcasting like streaming on
twitch tv
it's the stupidest reason ever like just
an example of like a low quality problem
but one that i that got me to where i am
today
uh i did it because i felt that nobody
on league of legends was positive
that's really why i started my broadcast
like i'm dead serious like people that
know me long enough will verify this
maybe in the comments or something that
i actually did this
that that the reason why i started
broadcasting was because there just
wasn't a lot of positive people in
league of legends and i and it bothered
the hell out of me and i wanted to like
create a positive community around
league of legends it was so toxic right
i came from heroes of new earth which
was even more toxic than that if you can
believe it and i was like man league of
legends shouldn't be the same way we
should make it more positive so i
started a stream that was about
positivity and jungling and teaching
jungle aid and positivity and uh lo and
behold like riot thought that that was
so cool that they featured it on the
client and and and then my stream was on
the client and then all of a sudden like
oh my god i've got like a career like
well this is nuts right so it's like an
example that like you don't have to
start off with like oh like devinash
trying to solve world hunger like i
started off like super
dumb problems like in a way like
the problem i'm trying to solve now is
dumb like the agency world is is just
like an aspect of marketing that i'm
passionate about i'm not like saving
children you know like i'm just solving
a problem that i want to solve and
then inadvertently all the other stuff
falls into place so hard to believe
because everybody's telling you to like
go for these like revenue goals and go
for everything but like really to create
value just start trying to solve a
problem and then if you start solving
that problem then the other stuff will
fall into place i promise it will i know
it sounds that's like the kind of
subjective leap that a lot of people
have to make in their head where you
probably don't see the one-to-one where
it's like okay i'm solving this problem
but like nothing else is falling into
place like well
then that might be the point where you
look at like techniques and
uh quantitative ways to like actually
increase your income around solving that
problem or monetizing that maybe at that
point you need to take like a course
that says okay here's how to like better
monetize this like maybe while solving
this problem i can create an info
product around it right
um that might be an option okay so if i
think that way
then like
i i like most people are reversing it
they're consuming all this content about
how to make more income and like how to
build a better business and everything
but they don't like have a problem
they're solving and so that that's that
stuff is getting wasted you might be
spending hours of your time on like
self-improvement stuff that you're not
actually doing and at the same time then
you're basically just procrastinating
you're gaining a uh a dopamine hit for
something that you're not even doing
whereas if you reverse you say okay
solve a problem and then consume
the necessary type of content around
how to
better solve that problem and add more
value within that context
you will feel better
and that's how i think you get over
these like really big
mental blocks and stress in business
it's it's a two-part formula discussed
in this video like number one you need
to understand the level of success that
you want to achieve
and and why you want to achieve it
and and what the sacrifice entails
within that right so two and three
bullet points one and three bullet
points and then number two
once you do understand that's level of
sacrifice you need to understand
what problem you want to solve
so
i
if you put those two things together
i think you'll be really impressed with
how much
more mentally stable
you are
in the achievement of these goals
regardless of
the
of
the
decision that you made in the level that
you want to reach you are still going to
encounter
hardship and hardship is going to again
be proportional to the level of success
you've decided to try to create
where greater levels of success will
require greater levels of hardship
as like a
just a scale like a hockey stick
right
um but if you know that that's your
direction and you know you're trying to
solve a problem you'll feel a lot better
about doing it at any level
i just think that most people are
focusing on the wrong things well what
do you think leave a comment tell me and
hopefully this video was not just me
rambling and meaningful
meaningful to somebody because again you
know
digital removal i'm not sure like how
much impact i have
and if it was you can tell me
because you can comment i'll read it
