this is a video about hiring for your
business which might come sooner than
you think so this video applies to
almost everybody who is going to be
doing any kind of self-study enterprise
and building a team is
pretty much the best thing you can do to
be able to ramp up your business and
your success so let's start about how
this got inspired by the mastermind chat
as many of these talks do and that's our
bud a-links here saying that i don't
know if there was a video already made
on this i sold my trucking company got
out of the industry and now i'm doing
advertising for pressure washing
services picked up a gig and i also have
a youtube bringing in some money
but when do i outsource and hire if you
have a situation like mine
and how would you hire so today we're
going to be looking at this and we're
going to kind of be looking at options
to hire people and kind of how to do
that and some of the considerations you
make
so
i'm going to start this off by telling
you one of the most important things
that you're ever going to hear about
hiring
and that is that you should hire
somebody whether it be on a small basis
or a full-time basis you should hire
somebody if you've never done it before
you should do that much sooner than
later the reason is because
if you watched my last video about
mental barriers and success
i guess i'm on this kick right now as of
the time of this filming but i've just
started to believe this more and more
that's there's enough knowledge out
there there's so much knowledge out
there of like how to do things actually
this is like a very technical video
about hiring but there's so much
knowledge about how to do this stuff
like you probably find 200 other youtube
videos about how to hire people but what
you can't find and what i think is
really rare is the
um
talking about and working through mental
barriers of success which are much more
significant one of the biggest mental
barriers biggest mental barriers
to success in business
is adding someone to your business even
if it's somebody that does a project on
a contract for you for like 30 bucks
most people don't ever
come
away from being self-employed to adding
one person to their business and i think
a real business is a business that
incorporates a team
so for the very reason that what you
should just
if all you do is you just add one person
even if you don't need it
i think that's a big step in business
because
it
allows you to
mentally step out of the idea of being
self-sufficient and just doing
everything on your own into the real
business owner mindset so just keep that
in mind going forward that i think that
people should hire much sooner than
later even if there's not a need for it
and then hiring doesn't necessarily mean
full-time employee and we're going to
talk about that now as i just pull up
those notes so i think that there's
really two
reasons
to hire well there's one reason to hire
and there's two ways to do it
the reason to hire is always the same
if you are individually working
40 or 50 plus hours a week
you need to hire
right i told you this is going to be a
technical video this is pretty simple if
you if you're individually working 40
hours a week
you need to hire and then i'm going to
tell you
the two categories that i think you need
to hire
for so you get the first type of hiring
is full-time employee full-time or
part-time employee
and the second is contractor and for the
purposes of this video this is really
the only two that we are going to
entertain i don't like interns i really
don't like volunteers for your first
hires you should have a person who is
accountable to you i'm pretty sure i
have other content on this but if not
i'll just say it real quick
if you are in business for the first
time do not intern people don't bring in
people from your community if you're
like a creator whatever you should pay
those people something and there should
be a list of performance indicators
however small even those two or three
bullet points that you hold that person
too when you don't pay someone they
don't really owe you anything and you
don't want to get into the mindset of
not paying people and then
them
feeling like they owe you something
because they respect you as a creator or
they respect you as a business person or
they want to learn from you or whatever
and you don't give them money back
starts to set you up as a both unethical
and unreasonable business partner you
shouldn't business person you shouldn't
do that you should not intern people
generally uh if you're a very large
corporation or like a vp and you have a
department of like 500 people there's
like intern type opportunities over
there because those people couldn't
otherwise get those opportunities with
that infrastructure but if you're a
small business you should not intern in
my opinion so i'm only going to cover
these two right now contractors and
full-time employees so full-time
employees are pretty straightforward so
do you have a problem do i have a
problem in my business
that takes 40 plus hours a week to solve
and part time is exactly this question
but with 20 hours a week
if you do not have a problem in your
business that takes 40 plus hours a week
to solve or 20 hours a week to solve you
need a contractor not an employee this
is a mistake that many startup
businesses make so if you are a 40 to 50
hour a week person right now
and then you
decide you want to hire somebody
and you can only
give that person 10 hours a week of work
then that person is getting paid for 30
hours a week of work that they aren't
earning and this is actually like this
is a simple problem but it's something
that like every corporation
makes a mistake on all the time
in fact major corporations if you go to
fang companies
half of their people are not working any
of the time and their their true output
is like 10 15 hours a week maybe if
they're lucky most workers are
enormously inefficient and the reason
for this not to kind of get off of a
side track but just so you know
those larger corporations oftentimes can
multiply profit because of the type of
products they have whether they be like
ad based or digital based the scaling of
those products is massive right so if
you build a net like something like a
netflix
and you have
millions of people on subscriptions
the amount of work it takes to maintain
and update that platform could never
equate to the profits
and the expenditure that you're putting
out
one-to-one with your employees right
you're just gonna have so much profit
you don't know what to do it just
generate crazy amount of cash that's the
nature of bigger businesses sas products
digital products subscription services
especially in this day and age so people
hire people managers hire people because
they have large budgets and then those
people don't end up doing
anything for you as a small business
owner you don't have the luxury of i
assume of millions and millions of
dollars of profit to be able to hire
people that are going to work at 10 or
15 efficiency so you have to right up
front determine if you have enough work
for a person to absorb 40 or 20 hours a
week of work and then establish a
full-time or part-time employee based on
that
that evaluation
once you make that evaluation
you have to be clear on what that person
is going to do and you should make sure
that you are filling critical
departments first so in my opinion the
first department to fill for a full or
part-time employee in almost any
business is sales
or lead generation which is the same
thing or lead up to sales
and then after that you can contract
sales too depending on your business but
for any kind of like product based or
like service based company where user
acquisition is your main
objective
you are going to want to onboard people
for sales first usually
people might say well what about like
logistical stuff like contract like uh a
lot of people actually think of
accounting first they think of like
business logistics first but you can
contract that and you should contract
that you can even go through like a bank
for money for some money per month you
know like 100 to 150 dollars
i the first couple of companies that i
started ran off of banks and it was fine
and actually we don't have the only
company i ever got a full-time finance
person for
was counter logic gaming and that was at
i think like 40 or 50
employees where it made sense to do that
and actually even still that person
still shared a lot of responsibility so
i think that
accounting and business supply chain
logistics type of positions like that hr
sort of things like that come way way
later than people think they do and at
first you want to start with sales
and such okay but let's say for the vast
majority of the rest of you
you're not finding a problem that's
going to take 40 or 20 hours a week to
solve that'll be most businesses right
even now in a business with the business
i currently run as the time of this
recording has about
i think seven or eight full-time
employees
and then there's four or five more
part-time and then beyond that as all
contractors the vast majority of work we
do as contractors and i could probably
contract even more the only thing that i
don't contract is sales fully i never
contract sales because i want those
people to intimately understand our
product and service
and also have an ongoing relationship
with the company
those are usually people that i'll
elevate to positions later on
of significance once they kind of like
cut their teeth
in the
in the sales world
of our business okay so contractors are
everything else
and a contractor represents
here's how to determine if you want
contractors so as a so the first thing
you do is as an owner
build a google doc
excel sheet
of all activities that are not
your primary strength
and then
put an hour
per week
assessment on each so this might look
like if i so like for me if i
am running let's just say like right now
i have no contractors and i'm just doing
content creation okay and this is like
an example for this
so my job might be
five this is per week so just so we
don't have to type it a bunch of times
five hours
content ideation
seven hours
video editing
um
two hours marketing and promotion
two hours thumbnail design
okay and
you can
maybe this like goes up a lot
and i want to actually like have this
equal
let's see
if we can like double these numbers and
get kind of close so this is 27
31 35.
so this gets close to full time that's
good so even now if i'm doing this this
is like a ton of
ton of time where i don't even think 10
hours of content ideation per week is
reasonable so so maybe like let's say
we're doing like high
edit type stuff we're doing like three
videos let's say it's like 30 hours
video editing marketing and promotion
right
a six hour sponsorship outreach
opportunity
okay we take a look and we make this
list and then and using a lynx's case
he might look at his pressure washing
company and then say okay this is the
amount of time i actually spend pressure
washing and then the obvious thing to me
is you hire a part-time person that goes
out on those
calls and does that for you
and in that case you don't really
contract right but going back to the
content creator example
so let's say you're spending 30 hours
video editing i mean to me
the very obvious thing to cut out here
right is video editing and if you build
this list yourself for your own business
you'll find really quick what you mean
but you'll notice i have a caveat here
that says
primary strength so what i mean by that
it means that you have to take what
you're really good at and keep doing
that so this is something that will stay
consistent for you throughout your
entire journey in business and as an
executive
if you're really good at
something you should keep doing it it
kind of doesn't matter how big your
business gets if you're really good at
doing something and you're better than
anybody else you should keep doing it so
i'm really good at marketing
and bringing users to places i'm really
good at understanding the marketing
world and i'm really good at talking
about it so i will never outsource those
things even if they take a
ridiculous amount of time per week
i might just do less of it but i will
still do that thing because that's my
huge strength because hiring for that
i'm unlikely to find somebody that is
better than me at that it's possible but
it's pretty unlikely and even if i do
then i'm working on things that are less
that i can make less impact on because
i'm just not as good at those things
so for example
if you look at like anything else
thumbnail design
um uh ideation for videos
or whatever
i'm not going to be as strong at those
things so those are things that i'm
going to contract so
you have to look at what your primary
core competency is so in the case of
someone like ailinks for example his
core competency probably isn't pressure
washing i mean maybe it is like like the
physical process of pressure washing
and
he's saying that he's doing all his own
planning marketing advertising working
editing et cetera
so he has to take a look at
what is taking that time
and then make an assessment on what you
can contract and outsource okay so once
you contract and outsource you determine
like let's say okay i figured out out of
this list
i'm going to axe this
contract
and then i'll contract this too
and then i'll actually contract this too
and i'm only going to work on content
ideation and the actual process of video
editing because that's what i think i'm
good at but for other people maybe you
think that you're really good at
reaching out for sponsorships and just
talking to people there's actually
broadcasters i know who are just really
great at that so or
or youtubers too
i was just thinking of one particular
broadcaster is a zizeron uh he's he runs
the gauntlet path of exile league and he
is great at getting sponsors for that
league so this is like one of the things
that he wouldn't contract out because he
prefers to do all of his own deals but
there's plenty of other people that are
just like hey i don't want to touch
deals like i don't care so let me talk
to an agency
other people like video editors they
love video editing and they're really
good at it and they and it speaks to
their artistic vision of what they want
for their content creation so they just
do it other people they don't want to
touch video on it so you see what i mean
so you figure this out but let's say
that you figured this out and you
figured out that you're really good at
video editing and you figured out you're
really good at coming up with ideas but
the rest of the stuff you want to just
kind of contract how do you do it okay
so there's two ways to do it the first
one is if you can find the job and it's
not a weird niche
the answer is just fiber
it's actually just fiber
fiber is crazy
it's like you could do anything so we go
here and we do like thumbnail design
so like right now i pay
30
per thumbnail
and i pay 15
for runner-up thumbnails so even if a
thumbnail never sees the light of day i
will pay
the second person who gets close enough
to making the thumbnail i want and i
will pay the person that designed the
thumbnail that we do end up choosing
but here on thumbnail design i can find
a person who for
25 bucks or less
will draw a thumbnail
they'll do like custom drawn thumbnails
out of pakistan or who the hell knows
this is actually the united states
and
they'll do it in a two to four day
turnaround they have tons of reviews
and i can do infinite revisions
so
i already outsourced
this thing right here
but what about like marketing and
promotion you might say okay that's
great for like design and graph design
okay we just do copywriting right
and here's people who will literally
write your newsletter they'll write your
website for whatever starting at 30 to
50 bucks so you can just write your
whole newsletter every week i actually
figured out when i was looking at the
newsletter design for metamarketing and
i originally i i
ended up deciding that metamarketing the
report that comes out bi-weekly on
fridays
was going to be
a video because that's my strength so
again i focus on doing my strengths
but if and i realized that doing a
newsletter was not my strength but if i
wanted to i could have just
paid 40 bucks a newsletter and just
tossed good work out like you just go to
newsletter writing
and people do it
i'll write your email newsletter people
write tons of them and they're actually
great like the content is really good
people are gonna think like when i'm
suggesting fiverr they're like oh like
well this is gonna be ghost written it's
gonna be poor no it's like really good
work it's super super good work even if
it's not outside the outside of the
united states people do really good work
they write so many of these that they're
super good at you'll never be able to
tell this dumb fiber is ghost written or
whatever
a lot of celebrities go write their
books a lot of people business owners go
through their stuff so right there you
can outsource that right finding
sponsorships and opportunities right um
i don't even know how to search for this
but it's there right
uh i'll do
real estate agent stuff sourcing agents
evaluate projects in china so right you
just have to start opening your mind and
fiverr is like an incredible source for
this so you can outsource everything via
fiverr if you can't find it on fiverr
you can use upwork
upwork is basically a place where you
can post jobs
so if i don't
if i if i can't use the fiverr database
to find something or it's too niche
like i want to do a specific marketing
deck
for
a particular drop or brand or something
and i don't think that somebody on
fiverr can do something that specific i
just go to upwork and i post the job and
then i post the amount that i want and i
accept bids for it and then i get a
bazillion offers and i select the one
that's best for me
and i've almost never been disappointed
by this option so this is just the the
raw technical technicals of just how to
do this like a lot of people are going
to tell you oh yeah you should get a
contractor i'm just telling you how to
do it like literally
so you should if you have never
paid another person before to do
something for your business
you should go
in the next week you should go in the
next three days you should go out
and you should contract somebody to do
something for you you should pay them
preferably more than one project but
just do one project
and then you'll graduate from a
random person who is trying to do
business to a actual business person
who's paying people out in business
expenses and then you'll find
that the entire
incentive system
to is supporting you and all of a sudden
stuff starts to become really unfair
like for example all the money that i
spend on fiverr is tax deductible
against anything i earn because it's a
business expense right so as i pay
people and i contract them it doesn't
tax me that's that's crazy that's really
busted and and it goes on and also they
and then i also get a thing and then the
thing that i pay for
provides me exponentially more value
right so the last video that i made
uh keep in mind this doesn't always
happen
but just as an example
so the total cost
of making i i edit my own stuff because
i don't edit because i just sit here and
talk but this video which is
uh nearing 70k views
this video earned 430 dollars so far i
paid
i think 30 plus 15 so 45 so net this
video made about like 380 dollars
just
that was the cost of doing the thumbnail
which i think is great
and
dude that was it i could have paid less
by the way too i could have paid 25
dollars and gotten a thumbnail turned
around for this
by going to
fiverr and just doing it
so that's pretty strong
and that's the roi so not only is it a
business expense but you also get
a uh an exorbitant amount of roi from it
too
okay let me check my notes and just make
sure
have i covered anything
okay so
the follow-up question from a links to
mastermind chat was
what is the first thing you'd outsource
and hire for if your situation were
somewhere so we covered that that's just
like making a list on excel
how do you give someone else trust okay
so that's a mental thing
you're gonna think that you're good at
everything because you're a business
owner
but
you have to have good introspection
about what your strengths and weaknesses
are
because
you have to be able to say i am very
good at that which is hard to do it's
also hard to say i'm very bad at
something so for example i'm really bad
at design it sucks but i think that i
could spend a lot of time
getting
trying to be artistic and trying to come
up with good ideas for things like
thumbnails or graphics but i'm just not
good at it i wish i was i'm quite good
at copywriting and writing websites or
writing things that
appeal to people but when it comes to
design i just can't i can't nail it so
could i spend
a hundred two hundred a thousand five
thousand hours and become a master of
design i i think i could do that i think
anybody can do that but i'm not gonna do
that doesn't particularly reach out to
me or speak to me so i'm gonna outsource
that right so that's how you figure that
out as to how do you give people trust
for that there are several ways
i could give you a lot of mental
gymnastics that you can do that kind of
get yourself over the idea of
giving away pieces of your business but
you could also just physically entrust
them to it so for example with sales or
something like that
we have overly competitive
compensation structures
with no cap for people when i say no cap
i mean there's like there's no limit to
the amount of commission they can earn
if they keep selling
as long as that person keeps performing
they basically have a profit share
of every deal they get
and
i do that because i want people to share
in the successes of the business another
way to do this is rsus so for example
like with a pressure washing company you
could say i'm going to pay you 30 bucks
an hour you could also say
i'm going to pay you
15
of the job i get and
x dollars per hour
just like you could go to a manager of a
restaurant say hey i want you to manage
this restaurant end to end but i'll pay
you 10 of the total profits at the end
of the year
right
um
versus most people that run that kind of
thing would just say hey i'm going to
pay you by 50 60k a year and be good
with it
i always like incentive structures that
incorporate contractors and employees
into the business more
i would do this for anyone whose job is
not
incredibly simple so like for
someone that's building
like thumbnails or something it's a
pretty straightforward relationship so
you don't need to like give them a
profit share
although
i do
increase
the rate of those sorts of things for
those sorts of contracts proportional to
how much the business is earning so if
the youtube starts doing like incredibly
well i'll pay way above market rate for
those things
but for everything else you can do some
kind of like profit share it's going to
cost you more but people will be more
invested and you'll have
more trust by virtue that they have some
kind of skin in the game for that if if
they cause you to win harder
then they win also one of the biggest
problems with business today is that
people that are working for you
don't
usually have a way
to
like if a person is in a position that
again is not like a really
straightforward role like it's a highly
creative role that's adding to the
business
and their role is
not compensated proportional to the
impact they're making
so it's like
boss makes a dime or i make a nickel
boss makes a dime that's why i poop on
company time right if it's that kind of
situation
where
a person doesn't earn
proportional to the kind of difference
they make it's like i can work 50 harder
and output 100
more but the salary is the same people
will vibe with me on like people that
have had jobs like this
that's not good like that's that's not
good if you are having those
relationships now sometimes in like
entry-level positions for full-time and
part-time employees and such that's
probably more okay
there should still be some kind of
way that they can all move up in the
company that is understood by them
i mean if they meet certain objectives
honestly some people just stay at the
same position forever and they didn't
they not and they're okay i was like
when i was a early stage entrepreneur i
was always trying to upgrade people to
directors to teach everybody to be like
a vp
and actually had a guy one time i'll
never forget this
i wanted him to
move towards vp and he's like you know
i'm cool i'm just good man i'm like i'm
good where i am i'm happy i don't
particularly want that level of
responsibility that kind of stress at
your job fine right so that was
something i learned because you have to
assess people's own individual ambition
and realize that as a business owner or
a person that's trying to start off on
your own
you're already above the average level
of ambition and someone like me that's
like all right let's do it like you're
going to become a vp you're going to get
120 hours a week you're going to work
and you're going to get equity options
in rsu's you're going to make a million
dollars something like whoa dude i just
want to show my family and like paint
warhammer figurines okay all right like
right like you gotta suss that out
it may not be for them so
you
wanna give those options to people
and then as far as like
how to determine if those people are the
right person for it
yeah you test them out but i
this
is in the leadership and to some extent
it's a separate video
but just to suffice to say about
leadership
you want to give people
almost total control over the projects
that they have like i
really really believe straw if i believe
in anything in business i believe in
giving people ownership over
what they
are doing and and so i think the way
that looks is
whether it be a contractor or an
employee
you say
at the beginning of every project you
say here's the scope of this project
what do you think we should do
like i want to
get a
pet food brand within a month
that
supports five influencers which ones do
you think we should reach out to
what should our email cadence be
how do you think that works that'd be
example conversation i have with like a
sales person which like most people
their conversation would be hey reach
out to this brand this brand this brand
do this lead gen here do this right
different speed like you want to bring
people into the fold
a lot and and and that's
contrary to what a lot of business
owners feel because they think that like
someone might learn your secrets or
steal your business or whatever
and that's like such a
weird thing because everybody eats
i don't believe in scarcity and business
i think that there's like enough market
share
for
everybody and i also just i i've never
had anybody like steal my business
or or
even try like anybody i always view like
anybody that even tries to do that will
just fail like everyone's always like
i i get this a lot the people come into
my discord or something they'll be like
hey i have an agency
um
i don't want to like talk about it here
because i don't want to like i'm worried
that i you know i don't want to offend
devin because maybe i'm competing with
nova you're not competing with me i
don't care most likely none of our
clients will ever meet or see each other
and even if they do
i'm
confident enough in my constant strive
for
improvement and
effort in running a business that i will
be able to
continuously acquire clients
even if i'm losing clients to another
agency
even if i lose them quite a few times
but also
there's collaboration opportunities
right there all kinds of things
different mindsets this is really a
different video we're talking about
hiring i detract too much from these
okay point is
i guess the the context of that was
you you shouldn't be afraid to trust
somebody with a lot of power
and one of the easiest ways to do this
in like a product-based business
tactically is just set a number
like
everything 250
or lower you can just solve that problem
like here's a credit card the limit is
the limit spend is this per day
and you just set that up with the bank
solve every problem so like if you're if
you have a customer
base that is returning two percent of
your products
and your product like average is like
forty dollars it costs like fifty
dollars to return a product and process
that just give somebody the ability to
do that like give somebody the ability
to us to individually assess when those
returns should happen which in my
opinion should be like all the time if
any like if anybody asks for a return
for a product for any reason you should
return it usually
unless i get obvious scam
give somebody the power to do that don't
be filling your email with all these
problems and worrying about that like
that's a lot of dumb you have to
worry about like give that to somebody
else right and
more more importantly give that person
the agency to do that themselves
if you
are
like there should be a dollar amount of
problem that you just don't look at so
like for example
within novo
i don't look at deals that are below 25
000
as a business so like our business just
doesn't look at deals that are below 25
000 if you do if you don't have 25 000
and you come to us we just don't talk to
you right i mean we'll talk to you but
we'll say thanks
um there's other work you can do come
back if you have a serious budget and
then i don't personally join a phone
call unless the deal is a hundred
thousand dollars or less or more
100 000 or more i just don't join the
phone call so
um
like like look if you want a decision
maker or you want devon on a call that's
the deal value that we're talking about
to be able to proceed
so
that number was a lot lower right when i
started the business like we could
we could do um
five thousand dollars
maybe or whatever the hell would take
anything right but as you get more
sophisticated you know your time needs
to be spent on other things so
that's just my own thing so
beyond that you talk to somebody on my
team if you have like a five or ten
thousand dollar deal that we're going to
consider
or you want to consider
budgeting creative options for like a
deal of a hundred thousand dollars or
less than you talk to someone on my team
so in the same exact way you can and
those people by the way have total
agency over those decisions like like
they can they can do anything within
that context but if you have a deal it's
like over a hundred thousand dollars you
should talk to me so
that kind of same management philosophy
can be applied across to like full-time
or part-time employees i'm just gonna
give this person the ability to have
full agency over every deal
at
ten thousand dollars or less
because i'm too busy trying to chase the
like 100k to 150k or whatever you're
doing right
or i'm going to have this person deal
with every customer management problem
every resource problem in my product
based business that is beneath 250 to
solve which will eliminate like 90 of
your problems and then if i have a
client that's bought like wholesale
you know 25 000 worth of product and
they're selling it somewhere i'll deal
with that myself
let's say that your employee screws it
up and gets it completely wrong
well there is always the option in a
business for you as the owner to come in
and say hey i think this got messed up
um this is my fault i took total
ownership of this here's how i'm going
to fix it
and you fix it as a team do not
string your employee out ever right even
if your employee completely messed it up
totally on their own you are still
responsible as the owner of that company
go in and say it was my fault stuff got
mixed up in the apartment here's how i
intend to fix it what else do you want
us to do really sorry about this right
a big part of like trusting people to do
things for you is realizing that you can
always repair those problems through
taking total ownership and just
legitimately making them better at a
cost to yourself
either a time or monetary cost
i'm okay contracting stuff out and not
being that great and paying somebody for
it because it's a learning lesson for me
i'm okay with having a part-time or
full-time employee screw up and take
personal ownership of that because
that's a learning lesson as well and
because it's learned lesson for that
person so i'm growing that person and
because oftentimes i can know all the
time i can just enter into that
relationship if i need to and just say
hey how do we fix this or here's how to
fix this
and it's fine
so the trust thing is like an ego thing
you just have to get over as an owner
and you get over it by those ways
cool so those are some considerations to
hiring full-time versus part-time and
hiring contractors i think the vast
majority of you should have contractors
for the things that are taking too much
of your time so that you can focus on
the things that you want to focus on
that are your strengths anyway and you
can excel your business you should be
working on things only that can
exponentially increase the value of your
business
for me even though thumbnail design for
example or graphic design for my company
is really important it's like super
important and like
like literally a huge part of the
success of my videos
i can't individually focus on that
because i just have to think about the
idea and the direction and that's where
my strength is and that's also where i'm
going to get the most amount of value so
if i spend two hours
in photoshop designing something or i
spent two hours sitting here saying what
is going to be the next thing that takes
off from my youtube right and then
designing an idea in the script for that
and building that and then filming it
that's a much better use of my time
because that's going to be the thing
that like 10x is my multiplier in the
exact same way it's like okay right now
in novo for example i'm rewriting the
website the nova.tv website i'm
rewriting it
for
uh to better kind of describe what our
business does so why am i doing that and
why am i not outsourcing that for
anywhere between you know if you want to
pay a good copyright it's like five to
twenty thousand dollars and if you wanna
get like okay copyright it's like one to
five hundred dollars so why wouldn't i
pay twenty thousand dollars to get an
expert copywriter to write to write that
well because i think i'm really good at
it i think i understand the mission and
i think it's a exponential use of my
time because it's turned out that that
website has gotten us a lot of inbound
business surprisingly people go to the
website they figure out what we're about
and then they reach out to us but at the
time that i wrote the original website i
wrote the whole website that you see now
at nova.tv i might as well just pull it
up this is a video after all sometimes i
forget
this was a different version of the
company than what currently exists so i
have to write out a more current version
of the company
and i'm not going to use an employee or
contract to do that but
this
type of graphics design and the way this
website
is designed with like the moving
elements and these pictures we outsource
and contract all of that it's not a
full-time or part-time person that does
that it's a contractor that does all of
this and they get paid by the hour so
all this text you see is me
and all this graphics and the actual
design is a contractor that's a perfect
example of what i'm talking about in
this video
so i will do the writing myself because
i think it's hard to find somebody that
can do it better
and i it's really my core strength but
all the design elements and the other
things that make this website just it's
just as important right it's just as
important to make it as successful those
will be contracted outsourcing so that's
some kind of ways to think about that
think about your business cool all right
so i hope this video was helpful
leave a comment if it was or if it
wasn't and just thanks for all your time
and support everybody
appreciate you okay see you next time
bye
