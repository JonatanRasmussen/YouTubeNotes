I had I had a couple questions but
they're a little bit more
specific to my business so I had added
you on uh
um on Discord so thanks for that I was
gonna put a message together
um but I I don't know
how much context I have to give here as
far as like the setup but basically
um just had a couple quick questions for
you my business uh is all around window
tinting I've done videos for a long time
I have a really successful online store
now which is super cool
um but I've been casually kind of
working with a company for a while
um we have like a loose agreement where
I get
uh 20 of
film sales and then they drop ship it
right from their facility
but I've got a really big Facebook group
um I've got a really big Community
overall so they've gotten like a ton
attraction from just the exposure
um moving forward with them
um we've done like a lot of cool
projects and stuff uh together but I
definitely feel like they're probably
getting the better end of the bargain
right now so
as far as like moving forward with a
company like that
um where things kind of start out pretty
loose and then all of a sudden like
there's a lot more money and growth
involved
um
I don't know if this would be like a
private consultation thing but do you
have any advice for like
kind of like renegotiating terms and
stuff I don't even know what to ask from
them necessarily on this because like
all the sales go through my site and
then they get traffic to their site
um and they have like
a lot of yeah they just you have they do
a lot of business now
I feel like that's um a specific
Consulting question because I need so
much context to answer and and construct
an offer I can talk in general about how
to build offers
um okay
and the the consulting stuff with me is
really easy now you can auto book it on
calendar if you want
um but yeah I might shut that down
actually no yeah I know yeah so uh it's
just taking too much time um but but uh
okay yeah but but uh but it's up for now
so so if you want to book one just just
hit it up um but maybe my answer will
help you enough that you don't have to
um here so so and also like if if nobody
has other topics and stuff like that
like we could talk about this
potentially for a long time might just
solve your issue you don't have to do it
but let's see okay
um
it it's a lot of people have been asking
me about how to construct offers and so
like what's what are we talking about
like we're really talking about
how do you build more official
relationships with
other people and other businesses and
influencers and everything you're gonna
you're gonna be working with like a lot
of people and one of the projects I was
working on this week
was I was helping a content creator
build a advisory position out
for potentially advising on a game
and what that looked like
so I I think we could talk about
I wonder if I kind of need like to show
my screen for this actually it's kind of
interesting
um how this would work yeah I think I do
let's do that
uh
but also for people just listening you
don't have to watch it I'll just um
I'll just describe it it's just going to
be a little bit easier if I do it this
way
oh okay there's a watch button at the
top that's cool yeah you'll be able to
watch it
sweet
so
um what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
paint and obviously I don't have any
prep on this but I've done so many
hundreds of these I think it should be
fine
what we're gonna do is we're gonna
structure out in general what something
like this looks like so in general
you're gonna have the position on top
which is like a description or name of
of the position
this will start to make a lot of sense
just give it a second
and then we're gonna have an outcome
and then we're gonna have deliverables
and we're gonna say your side and then
we're gonna have deliverables
client side okay
and then and basically what we're doing
is we're building a term sheet and the
term sheet is just going to be there's a
lot of ways to do it I think this is the
best way to do it super straightforward
and not put a lot of [ __ ] into it
we're basically trying to figure out
what is
what is going to be exchanged what is
going to be returned so in this kind of
case and for the case that most of the
people listening to this are going to be
in the deliverables client side I'll say
slash sponsor slide are is going to be
money right so usually this comes in the
form of monthly salary right
flat cash payments
percentages of equity or company shares
that's basically most of the major ways
or some sometimes I'll put this too
because it's important sometimes
distribution slash ads exposure
which which is a deliverable if it's
Quantified um there's a lot of memes
around like exposure but it's actually
really legitimate if it's Quantified
then so most once you have this kind of
set up
you should determine
personally
how
you are going to get rewarded now
um I have some unique opinions on this
I've been asked to be an advisor
on many many different companies and
generally speaking I I I'm lucky enough
to universally turn these down because I
think that the return on investment for
investing in my own business is higher
but
early on in team dignitas before this is
like 2012 before I had sold my companies
I didn't have the income to do that and
so uh these kind of positions actually
helped me out a lot
and I'll I think here's where the value
is going to start coming in is the way
that I started structuring these
advisory positions or learn to structure
them was I would always put some kind of
salary in them so typically if you're
going to be doing some kind of official
relationship with the business
usually that exchange is not going to
involve cash payment to you for
influencers we kind of think of it as
that like sponsor sponsors are going to
sponsor you and they're going to give
you sort of some money that's really
straightforward but actually like
outside of that relationship outside of
sponsor to your own individual
relationship there isn't a lot of
um that you know you don't see a lot of
flat cash
exchanging hands but but actually
there's no reason why I shouldn't it's
just not something that's really
stipulated in contracts and oftentimes
you can do something where it's like
okay I'm gonna provide this service
whether it be and now we start talking
about phone calls right like strategic
guidance
okay like ongoing Consulting
or
um Liaisons between a community or a
business and that business
clients business
are possibilities
um
availability
for meetings
connections
and networking and all this can be
Quantified like introduce me to two
people per month for example
um participation in events
corporate get-togethers right all this
stuff
mentorship and guidance of specific team
members
slash employees
so if you've followed so far you you're
starting to see how this kind of
agreement can be structured where maybe
I can sort of cherry pick
relevant to myself okay I need strategic
I'm going to be doing strategic guidance
I'm also be doing some connections I
need to be available for like one or two
meetings
every month let's say and then those
agree by deliverables and in exchange
maybe I want something like a monthly
salary and in that case either that is
typically between like
one in five thousand dollars
flat cash I would say is a lot more rare
and let's talk about equity for a second
because I think that Equity is I should
do a video on this it's actually one of
the most misunderstood things uh and
it'll help every single person in this
call
a lot of people put a unnecessary no a
just an outright wrong value on equity
so what is equity when a company
is created IT issues shares and let's
say issues uh 100 shares to be really
simple okay so it has to issue those
shares to someone that's going to
generally be the person that created the
company but if there's two people that
created the company
and they decide to
share it they decide to share this this
is to split it equally
well then they both get 50 shares and
those 50 shares because there's 100
shares issued is 50 so you effectively
own 50 equity in a company
so a lot of people say okay cool and
then we get into like valuations right
where evaluation is the theoretical
underlined I can't underline a notepad
but if I could I would underwent that 10
times the theoretical price a company
would sell for
so now if your company is worth a
thousand dollars
and you have 50 shares and you have 50
Equity now you have 500 dollars in
addition to
whatever income you're making or
anything like that so that's pretty cool
right except that
we generally tie Equity to valuations
that are entirely arbitrary
and
not even if a company is worth
something
your ability to actually sell that
company do the merger and acquisition
and complete that transaction
is
suspect you know maybe it happens maybe
it doesn't so right now
Novo is valued
at just north of 35 million
and do but but like
so I own 50 of that company so does that
mean that I have you know 17 or 20
million whatever that math is
it doesn't mean that I currently have
zero because if my co-founder gets hit
by a bus tomorrow
and I get a a concussion or something
and now I can't run this business that
number goes to zero right so it might
sound really impressive that I'm running
a 35 million dollar company and that's
been valued by a third party agency so
there are these agencies in mostly in
New York that will go out and they'll
take your assets they'll take your
contracts they'll take your client
relationships and they'll say okay
based on uh some kind of multiplier
meaning like when a person buys a
company they're buying it for a higher
amount than your Revenue by a certain
multiplier because obviously nobody
would sell a company
if for just the same Revenue that
they're making they just hold on to the
company right
so generally you're operating like a
three or five x multiplier and and
that's sort of also dependent on
economic conditions
um we were seeing companies like in Tech
going for like seven to nine X
multipliers or even higher like in 2020
and and and in the bull run but that's
not gonna happen again it's far more
realistic to expect like a like a 3X
multiplier which is what we work on
3x Revenue so
do I really have 35 million dollars no
right I have zero dollars until that
actually materializes and so the reason
why so I said before this is useful to
every single person in this phone call
right and the reason I said that is
because if you understand that principle
you understand that in a lot of cases
cash is more valuable than equity
and if you are particularly if you're
dealing in small amounts so this is why
like if you're going to take an advisory
position
or you're going to take some kind of
position in a company in exchange for
equity and often you'll see a lot of
Founders that understand this will offer
equity in companies they know are never
going to sell and I don't even know if
Nova's gonna sell because I could sell
it we've we've built this company to
sell specifically to larger Madison
Avenue agencies and it's not that I know
that it can't it won't sell it's just
that why why would I sell it I really
love what I do so does my co-founder and
we're just kind of printing cash in this
business maybe we'll just sit on it and
chill you know and I'll go see like what
Diablo 4 is about I don't know right
um there's that possibility in which
case everybody that is issued equity in
this company that is effectively zero so
you'll see that happen a lot right
um
that's why I I don't think
it's easy to get romantic about
employee stock option plans
and Equity plans
but for most people in this phone call
myself included
negotiating on monthly salary or flat
payments is better
because you can't expect that Equity to
realize there are also a lot of
stipulations
between
whether that Equity will materialize and
how it will materialize for example
there is a huge difference between
something like called preferred versus
common shares
where preferred Shares are issued to
investors first and effectively if a
business is cashed out on
um those preferred Shares are issued and
cashed out on First and the money that's
left over goes to Common shares
so if you have a situation like a
certain Esports team
that gets sold
and everybody has common shares
and the preferred shares get cashed out
first
none of the real people make any money
I don't know a situation like that but
it could happen
so you have to be very careful with how
you deal with Equity because it is a lot
more dangerous than people think
where Equity serves you the best is when
you retain ownership of a sellable asset
that you can turn key to someone else
so maybe
tint can tin Studio can move
his business over
to another person at some point and then
that Equity becomes worthwhile but until
then the Strategic relationship he's
dealing on should probably be on a cash
basis or distribution basis in exchange
for his services
I think there's like a stigma against
this
in business
and
um
there shouldn't be like you
[Music]
you you can actually make a really you
could really leverage Yourself by
negotiating monthly salary terms in a
bunch of your business relationships in
exchange for these deliverables and for
influencers
this deliverable slash sponsor side
relationship is is what I would first
build when I'm approaching like a brand
so I think Al Lynx for example
uh one of our community members
is he posted a mastermind chat uh GPT
3.5 readout of like a sponsor email
and I like hated it
um because I don't think gpt3 can write
sales emails yet
but if I were to write one it would
contain the basic bullet points of
deliverables that I would serve for
and it'd be in exchange for a monthly
amount
and what I would do for the brand is I
would offer them
I'm on the influencer side so I want as
many I want as long as a relationship as
possible but it's safe to offer a brand
like three months we at Nova we have a
thing called 210 which means but keep in
mind we're working for Brands so it's a
very big difference I'm not working for
influencers
um my intent is to get the brand the
best deal so I'll offer them what's
called a 210 which is two months on with
an optional renewal for 10 months for a
total of a year at the end of that
relationship that you want to offer
something similar but you want to get
something as long as you can so for
example you might offer three seven or
or three nine
um and and as objectively as you can
make those kpis like maybe it's a
certain amount of conversions maybe a
certain amount of like attention that
gets or maybe it's just a certain amount
of like ads and clips created
that would be the way that you would
structure that and you would just send
that out
um you know four or five times a day to
different interested clients
so so this is sort of the basic way that
I would consider building term sheets
and we can kind of expand from here
there's a question
is there a short-term value of this in
taking loans backed by Equity or
something along those lines loans are a
totally different thing so loans are
loans are something that are really
Market dependent
they're they're heavily dependent on the
interest rates you can get so that's
going to be dependent on the Fed
and also on your own credit score and
financial situation currently it is not
good to take loans because the federal
interest rate is something like five or
six percent
so what is a loan basically a loan is
you as a business owner or influencer or
person is taking a bet
that you are going to make more money
than you are paying back in interest so
if I have a hundred thousand dollars and
I'm
paying 10 on that right I'm paying ten
thousand dollars back my bet is with
that a hundred thousand dollars I could
make
more than ten thousand dollars probably
significantly more so that Capital would
be used to accelerate my business in
such a way that I will be making more
money than I would if I didn't do that
and Loans are a really underutilized
thing A lot of people are scared of
loans but there's a ton of ways out of
them and there is
um if you're if you're smart with your
money you're smart with your business
and you have like even halfway decent
credit
there are a lot of good there's a lot of
good plays to make with them we can talk
more about that but uh generally
speaking people won't loan you things
against Equity they'll loan things
against
um your credit score uh if they loan
something against your Equity that's
what that's what's called collateral I
used to do loans but when I do loans for
people
after I sold my marketing company
um this is like before Esports I had a
lot of cash on hand and I would loan out
money to construction companies in the
uh in the Nevada area and
um I would take collateral as cars or uh
portions of houses like really physical
things so generally people will not
take collateral against equity for all
the aforementioned reasons we just
talked about that Equity is like a very
nebulous thing and is only worth like
what
it's only worth what it sells for and
this is and if you understand these kind
of underlying Concepts it's why like
you'll watch my YouTube videos and
they'll be like yeah Face Clan isn't
worth [ __ ] right why would I say that
well because it's only worth what
somebody will buy it for which is
[ __ ] zero right and and if you look
at you know something like
any of these like major Esports teams I
think this is where we're kind of seeing
that right now
um most of those have been up for sale
on the market for the past like six to
eight months so nobody wants to buy them
so all these Forbes articles and all
these people that are claiming that TSM
and CLG and C9 are worth 340 million
dollars are it's zero dollars nobody
wants to buy it the only people in the
market to buy Esports stuff are Saudi
Arabians I don't even know why but they
are crazy about it and and they can't
own everything
um
and so you know the Middle East is like
putting some investment on it but other
than that yeah it's nothing yeah what's
up
yeah
okay so um I'm gonna try to phrase this
so it's applicable to everybody so I
reached out uh via cold message to a
startup company after I heard them on
garyvee's podcast
um I have a physical therapist I have a
background it was for a chair company
right and I just I Vibe with the the
creators and I have a meeting with them
next week and so you talked about kpis
in my message I talked about different
just like YouTube video optimization
Partnerships with different kind of
Brands as far as like equipment posture
resistance TRX I love TRX
um and I feel like there's ways that
this company can partner with them I
talked a little bit about B2B and then
content social media strategy
I have no idea as far as what
their availability of hiring someone and
paying someone but I would totally be
willing to leave my current position and
take a significant pay cut in order to
go down this path and
help with them my question is
how can we approach different kpis and
find that return on investment when I
guess I I'm not 100 sure how to put a
kpi on giving them ideas and content
creation strategies and giving them ways
to Market and promote their product
um
so when you're developing a term sheet a
relationship like this there are no hard
fast rules in as to how you negotiate it
and a lot of people have a problem with
this because
it essentially paralyzes them there's
there's too much to think about and even
in the way that you asked your question
you listed like a million different
things everything from like content
creation strategy to White guidance to
things like that that all could be their
own jobs or positions so the the problem
here is that
and I I can't describe how often this
happens to me in business
I wonder if it happens to other people I
get I guess this is just kind of our
line of work the most of the people that
are listening to this call
are either like adjacent to the
influencer marketing or like marketing
that you're doing some kind of marketing
or advertising or doing something for
yourself
in this field man there is so much
subjectivity it's not even funny it's
like it would surprise everybody here
there have been so many times I've been
on the phone and someone's like okay
what does that cost and I'm like uh uh
uh just like look at twenty thousand
dollars okay cool right like like uh
like good so you that there is an
objective way to do this and the
objective way to do it I'll I'll just
like I I don't think I don't know how
valuable this is but I'll tell you how
to do it it is you put a dollar per hour
cost on your time you say I think I'm
worth
a hundred bucks or 200 bucks or whatever
everybody in this call is worth at least
50. so that's your that's your Baseline
um I know everyone on this call can make
fifty dollars an hour because if you
wouldn't be in a mastermind if you could
if you uh could do that so I know
everybody can do that so you may not be
making it right now but I know you're
capable of it so that's that's the
Baseline but like above that maybe it's
it's 50 maybe it's whatever
um you say okay and how do you how do
you know the answer to that question
right well you say this is what I could
be making as an opportunity cost if I
wasn't doing this thing now once you
have that dollar cost per hour you you
know it's fairly simple to calculate
based on deliverables right you you
estimate the amount of time that you're
it's going to take you to do these
things
um and then you uh apply that to the
dollar per hour cost and you probably
assign some kind of multiplier which
which is like the opportunity cost of
doing this thing and not doing other
things
um and uh then you get a number and
mathematically like for people that are
really objective like that would be how
you solve that problem
um but
what I would do is if you were looking
at the term sheet that I also posted in
Devin's notepad now that's in that that
room
I would become
very very specific about exactly what
you're doing for this company
and what that looks like and I mean like
down to like this is the number of phone
calls I'm gonna take this is the number
of like strategic guidance sessions
we're gonna have and how long that's
going to take
and then
um if you are that specific
maybe it like at that point you could
even plug that thing into gpt4 and say
price this how much should it be worth
my time is this much out per hour do you
get an idea of it like it's literally
that arbitrary right
um
it there is no answer it there is
there's going to be some kind of like
determination you need to make based on
your knowledge of their business like
are they rolling in cash can they afford
a 20 000 a month advisor right that like
are you gonna provide that level of
value where the the previous advisor
deal that I just talked about
um I think that was negotiated either
fifteen thousand dollars a month
um twenty thousand dollars a month
uh it was around that range Equity was
one to five percent and for anybody
that's like considering any kind of like
Equity relationship I'll just like that
does have very objective numbers that I
could just structure for everybody right
here so typically like a CEO coming in
to like bring a company uh bring a new
startup
that already has a product that CEO can
expect to get anywhere between three
percent to a maximum I think of like 12
it's like an insane maximum of like the
company
uh an advisory position is almost always
going to be between like point five
percent and three percent I've seen them
as high as like five percent but that's
like for someone that's like on the
ground doing a ton of work
um pretty much every day
so that gives you a range for like
Equity but again like for cash
um it's so subjective like
for for some people in this phone call
two thousand dollars a month would like
would change their entire life for other
people twenty thousand wouldn't make a
difference
so it you have to also assess your own
individual situation
why and where you're at and and what it
feels like for doing that work
you also may be willing to take way less
money because you just there's some kind
of educational opportunity or some kind
of um huge networking opportunity where
if you get through the door doing that
now all of a sudden like your your
League's Beyond where you otherwise
would have been so that's a possibility
as well right and all that has to kind
of just but but like the way this starts
and like the answers to your question is
you have to really solidify your
deliverables the problem with your
question is you don't yourself know what
you're doing so how can your client know
yeah absolutely and and I guess that was
part of my question too is right there's
so many different things that I feel
like I could do and help just from a
quick glance over all of their different
social medias kind of understanding
where they're at looking at their
website understanding they have a a high
ticket product that easily solves
and solves the need and it's very you
can demonstrate it right through science
through evidence
um
and yeah I guess I part of me is like I
have no idea what number I would give
right and so you kind of talking about
the the 50 sharp point you know what is
the cost of Entry right you know if
you're if this would allow you to do
this type of thing in the future then
yeah you know maybe you should take a
little bit of a cut just so that you
you know it's just it is so subjective
and I think that's where I really
struggle with is because I
um if you couldn't tell I have all these
different ideas right and I can be
a wealth of idea generation for this
company and I feel like all of them
would be helpful but figuring out how to
like okay let's not
let's get really specific instead of
being incredibly here all these
different things like hey let's do this
and act on it right which has been
historically one of my weaknesses right
I think a master of many things is a
master of nothing
and if you have like all of these ideas
about how you can contribute to a
company
the that's actually a bad thing where
like for example if you look at somebody
just just use my myself as an example
right if you look at me and you say what
can you do for a company
um the list of what I can't do for a
company is much higher than what I can
do like I can't help you with HR I don't
know about that I can't help you about
like with your
um uh with like your individual i o for
like um like your engineering positions
or your comp size stuff like what I can
help you with is like brand and
advertising development right like so so
you hire me for that purpose and um it
becomes much easier to evaluate yourself
when you think of yourself as a
specialist in a couple of fields and you
learn in that direction
um a person and I I don't mean this um
inflammatory at all but a person that
comes to me and says hey I've got like
tons of ideas there's like a million
different things I can do that's an auto
decline for me because I know that
person doesn't specialize I know that
person isn't a true master and that's
generally how a lot of Founders think
like like if if you can't quantify to me
like what value you're bringing to the
table
um in in a few sentences
um you don't have your [ __ ] figured out
and and and so the first thing to do is
to figure that out right it's it's like
it's not that you don't have value it's
just that if you don't know your value
you can't provide it does that make
sense
yeah no absolutely and I agree with it
and I feel like part of me is like okay
once I'm given that opportunity
I'm a very quick Learners like okay I'm
gonna I'm gonna get this [ __ ] down and
I'm going to make sure that I'm over
delivering on whatever it is right this
is the the so this is this I I just like
if you were to I wish I could like um
hook up a neural link and you could you
could know every email I've ever gotten
that sounds exactly like this which is
like yo bro I I'd love to intern for
Novo I could do some SEO I could do some
writing I could do creative projects I
could help with project management I
could do all this stuff I've got a bunch
of ideas about how instant decline trash
get out like like dude it's the number
of pitches that I get like that from
people is endless but the number of
times that somebody has come to me and
is like bro I am a [ __ ] god at sales
I crush this [ __ ] I will I like my only
thing I do is I run outbound I will get
like I'll shoot you I'll shoot out 15
emails a day highly personalized that I
really understand your business from and
I'll get you on the phone with people
who are going to give you ad budget like
that's a serious [ __ ] email like that
I would really consider it does doesn't
matter from if it's first touch from who
or warm or cold do you see the
difference it's like it's like it it
somebody comes to me let me give you a
really good example of this is probably
the best [ __ ] example I I have so I
was um I was running CLG and um maybe
some people that are like like OG Devin
Nash streamer people would know the
story but like I was running CLG at the
time and uh this guy came into George's
chat
and was like I have a vision George is
my co-founder at CLG uh I I have a
vision for this is such a cool story oh
my God I'm like I said like remembering
this I have a vision for CLG
um right now where I think we could make
three meals a day happen for the entire
org I'm a cook uh this guy had like very
little experience like with actual no
experience at Esports nothing nothing
like that but he was like a line Chef
um for some restaurant and he's like
like and like just he's like who would I
talk to and of course George is like
talked to Devin like I'm not gonna
[ __ ] handle that [ __ ] so this guy
sends me an email and in this email is a
Google doc with this guy's plan to like
go to Sodexo pallet out a bunch of food
turn our literal home kitchen into like
a factory making chicken wings and
badass stuff and ribs for like tons of
people at CLG Eddie and like he just
wants a job he lives in Canada and he's
like and I call him up and he's just
like I just I know I can do this this is
what I do I I could I could make really
good food for everybody I didn't even
know I wanted this position I didn't and
I said yeah dude I'm down like let's go
let's do it I flew that guy out next
week that guy became Andrew Andrew
worked for that company I think for four
years until MSG finally sniped him
um off the face here like they do
everything but like
um he worked and like he revolutionized
CLG he was he was such a core part of it
um because we were able to have these
like huge family dinners like with like
50 people and we had freaking grills
going in like three refrigerators in a
house he was we were bribing allegedly
Sodexo people to like drive trucks onto
uh to deliver Palace onto residential
streets it was amazing and I had no idea
I even needed this but because this guy
had a really specific offer that was
really well thought out
um I I I I hired him immediately and
there is somebody that could send me
that email for Novo I I dude I can't
tell you especially like especially
lately because of the recession
how many people are sending me uh
requests to work here and I wrote a
really really cash heavy business in the
sense that like it does not take me many
people to do our business I I can I can
really sit on like three or four PMS I
don't even need sales I I just sit on
three or four PMs and just rake in cash
and and I don't I don't care I don't
need 50 employees and I I learned that
from CLG I didn't want to build a
business with like 110 employees again
um and so but despite that there is
somebody that that knows something that
I want that I don't know that I want and
has the confidence to to bring me into
it and this this meme of like I've got a
bunch of ideas man like oh God like like
that is you have not just like sit down
in a Google doc and written out what you
really want to be good at
and also furthermore you're afraid to
specialize that's that's another thing
too
um because it is really scary to to
Center on one thing it's pretty scary
for me to just be really good at
marketing and advertising and nothing
else because because I don't know it it
sometimes AI comes along or some
theoretical world where that's not
needed like whoops yeah but I think
everybody will always want to have
attention on them
yeah just some thoughts on that
no I I mean I really appreciate it I
think one of the biggest things you said
is like figuring out a couple things
that you like and learn in that
direction yeah in order to in order to
specialize and you know for me
personally like I know I don't want to
be a number one in a company I want to
be in a place that I am respected and
given autonomy and I just go out and try
to [ __ ] crush it for that company
right there's a product or service that
I believe in uh wholeheartedly and so I
have no problem and I've just not found
that opportunity and when I listen to
these guys I just I was like man like
this this is something that I really
feel like I would enjoy and
um
so thanks for the thanks for the
insights I appreciate it yeah I think I
think this comes down to and
um this is particularly just like a
thing with a lot of people is like can
you summarize what you would do in two
to three sentences and like once you're
there you can make like a bullet point
of what those durables actually look
like and this is for anybody that is
really trying to think about what they
want to be good at right like it's not
just you there's like so many people in
this position like I I the way that I
really found out about marketing was
because I am so fascinated to this day
constantly about like what makes people
tick I just love the idea of attention
especially in a world where there is so
much of it like so much content and so
many things like what makes somebody
focus on something that that they
wouldn't otherwise focus on the other
the other million choices that they have
why somebody watch an hour video of mine
like rather than like do anything else
right and so I'm really in just the
market of attention that's all I do and
now that I'm able to quantify that I
have a really clear product offer and
you have a really clear reason to listen
to me and and and hopefully you also
have a really clear reason to like not
listen to me about other things right
like um you know if it's like well what
like you know can you help rebuild our
you know our our uh computer science
department no I can't I don't know about
that right and so like you also gain a
lot of authenticity
when you you start
like I think it's more important a lot
of the times and it comes off a lot of
times
in relationships and life and everywhere
on what you don't do and what you won't
do than it is what you will do
like the list of What You Won't Do
should be way way way heavier than what
you will do
yeah
that's that's good good discussion I'm
glad you brought that up
yeah thanks for uh thanks for going over
that I think what I missed is I really
don't have a list of deliverables so
like I had a
um there was a a trainer that basically
came out to my shop
um and so I put aside like three days
um we we did some live streams with this
product that nobody had really seen
before we did some Tick Tock videos for
it one of them like did like almost five
million views on Tick Tock and two
million on YouTube
um but I wasn't sure going into it
how successful or what we would really
have but now I kind of have a framework
so once I did that you know more
companies are paying attention to what's
going on so then I had that other deal
going on so just kind of trying to
figure out
what you know you talked a lot about
um all the numbers are kind of arbitrary
but if you can figure out like an hourly
payment or you know day rates and stuff
like that that's yeah that's really
helpful I need to sit down and do that
yeah and um I have like rate cards where
I could kind of go through and and show
you a bunch of durables specifically so
if you really want to like structure
that out and like bake that there's
obviously like ways to make this more
official you just need a lot of context
um in this kind of conversation I have
limited ability to like impact things
because I just don't know everyone's
specific situation so so I won't have as
much um yeah I won't have as much uh
impact but there are a lot of ways to uh
really solidify it um and and But
ultimately yeah it just comes down to
two dudes talking you know wait wait I
just I like to keep that
very Zen perspective
um I I think the people should think in
that way more that it's like we get
really dramatic about like contracts and
like business relationships and revenue
and return on investment and all that
stuff it's just talking 99 of time like
that's every time that's every maybe
it's like three four Dudes and a girl
five I don't know you know like but you
know what I mean like it's just people
talking about making things happen
everything in business is that it's
really important to think I I think from
that's um that's what Elon Musk would
call First principles thinking which is
like okay at the basic idea what are we
trying to do we're trying to provide
value to each other the way that we do
that is we exchange currency and
services and and even currency is an
idea right and then once you like start
from that first principle the reason why
that's like important I know it sounds
like like some people oh this is like
really out there it's like it's like oh
yeah like value man but but that's like
the reason I'm bringing this up is like
when you think from that first
principles it allows you to strip away a
lot of the [ __ ] that
um would would conflate this deal and
then also overwhelm you because you'd
start thinking like oh
um there must be rules there must be
constraints there must be nobody knows
what the [ __ ] going on
you know like there's there's there's no
we're not running nuclear power plants
there's no rules to this [ __ ] it's just
two people talking
yeah that's that's been my experience
with most of what I've gotten through so
far and then to see like this one
company's business scale up so much over
the past
two or three years like they were nobody
a handful of years ago and now they're
in a in a hugely different position than
what they were so that all of a sudden
makes it like very real but I've always
had these like loose uh deals with it so
far up to this point so yeah
um I got some good ideas now that's
helpful excellent everybody's a nobody
until they're somebody
right can I um chime in on is that issue
that I'm having it's uh on the same
regards to like specializing yeah of
course
um so I'm working with a company right
now
um and we're like I would say like it's
pretty small but um uh they basically
have me running their YouTube but they
also have me running their website and I
feel like those are two very different
roles
um in terms of like what I'm good at
because I'm really good at YouTube but
I'm not good at the website and it's
taking like half my time and I'm
wondering like
is that like I don't know because
obviously optimally we'd have somebody
running the website somebody else who's
actually interested in that because I
just kind of do it because it's part of
the job
um but I don't also I also don't know if
that's my job to like hire for that in
my position I guess you would have to
know more about my position to really
tell me that but
um not necessarily I mean like the first
question that came to mind is like could
you just fiver this out and then do your
thing
um I might be able to my Pro the problem
with that I think would be just giving
them like a lot of control over like the
business because I think the owners
would probably not be cool with like
giving some random dude they don't know
access it took him a while to give me it
um so I think it would be kind of hard
to say do you do it I mean there there
are people there are people out there
right now that are like taking on jobs
I'm terrified of these people that apply
for my company like take on a job and
then just work like three other jobs
remotely and and are basically
Outsourcing the whole thing
um so I would say like
obviously the real ethical question here
is just like
um can you have a conversation
with you the owners and say hey if I
brought in like an assistant or team
member would that be okay for this
portion of the business so I could focus
more on this thing right would be like a
more ethical way to go about that but
the truth is like
the only the only way that I would
consider
what's I don't know what the percentage
is but you said it's taking half your
time I'm gonna go with that like let's
say it's 50 yeah yeah okay like then the
only the question if it's taking half
your time you're getting paid for it
well that's good unless that other 50
you're doing that you're you're better
at
you could scale that by 25 or additional
now you have 50 more room and then that
would make you more money that would
produce you more results if that's the
case now you've got a problem right like
if you're if you're doing a 50 50 work
but you're where you're supposed to be
well no matter but if you're in a
situation where it's like if I was able
to have the you know the X hours 20
hours more per week to work on YouTube
I'd be this much further ahead that's
what you start thinking about can I
Outsource this can I delegate this or if
it's valuable enough can I drop it
completely
okay yeah that makes sense right yeah
I don't delegate much now
um I think I think because so much of my
business
can be solved with AI
this is interesting like Novo is a
business it's weird all the crypto Bros
like moved over to AI I feel like and so
everybody that was like yo look at my
coin man it's like now they're like dude
Ai and I guess I didn't realize
I was one of the crypto Pros for a while
and now I'm embarrassed of that fact
retrospectively in the sense that like I
wasn't a practitioner was an investor
but what the [ __ ] does that mean let's
put money in that I ended up losing
right
um I wasn't a true practitioner in
cryptocurrency I was like running the
blockchains and like doing the [ __ ]
there's a big difference because now I
am a true practitioner in AI I really
use AI every single day we do about 10
million requests through GPT 3.5 every
day that's not an exaggeration that's
how many were limited rate Limited at by
Google
and uh I know a lot about AI that I feel
like other people don't know
um
and I think that AI can solve most of
the problems of Delegation for
any kind of like
bottom level 20 to 40 work that you're
doing you just have to kind of think
about what the right prompts are for
things like ongoing maintenance there's
Fiverr
um so like if you're running like a
website or you've got to like update
something
it feels like there's somebody in South
Africa that can do that for 15 an hour
and probably do it better than anybody
that's making 60k you're doing it
and and and I I don't at least I haven't
personally ever run into any security
concerns because a person that is rated
at 4500 reviews on Fiverr you know
that's like just just jamming out [ __ ]
like it's just not gonna be incentivized
whatsoever to compromise your security
they're probably there's probably some
dude some CFO at a bank that's
Contracting that guy out and and running
some like SPX level [ __ ] like there's
probably way crazier stuff that person
could do so so I think at a certain
level
it's all about time and and again time
value of money and like when the time
value of money doesn't start making
sense for you
um like delegation is a perfectly fine
place to go
we're selling courses and stuff so I
feel like it's a I don't know it's a lot
about creating the courser like there's
probably more product management than
anything
um but uh yeah no that's definitely
something I'll look into I've been using
chat gbt a lot too for like help with
YouTube but it's kind of annoying
because it's like
um I don't know it doesn't help with the
thing I'm not good at I think I'm good
at is YouTube I could do that myself too
but I feel like I I think I'm on track
to make two or three videos a week for
the Devon Nash Channel which is
incredible because of how efficient
GPT makes me at doing those like I I I
think prompts are a really important
thing to the extent that like there's
there's probably gonna be if not already
I've read some articles about like these
people popping up but prompt engineering
is like gonna be a real field
and and everyone should really explore
how to prompt I don't have a lot of
resources it's just it's just me doing
it
and I don't think it would be
valuable enough for me to Pivot my
content to how I'm doing it but
um
let me give you like an example of like
how crazy this is in The Mastermind
event chat
because it gets like pretty wild
um
scroll up and find this real quick
I also think there's a meaningful
difference for Content creators and
influencers between GPT 3.5 and gpt4 I'm
not certain that most people have access
to gbt4 yet we we do because we have a
relationship with open AI I think it has
like a rate limit or something for
paying subscribers I don't know
uh
where would I find this
yeah I found it so I prompted GPT with
the same
prompt
here in The Mastermind event chat which
will be here in a second
oh there's like a ton of chat okay we'll
get to that in a second
maybe this prompt alone will help some
people that's why I'm doing this
that was my prompt for this this is GPT
3.5's answer
and I'll go find your GPT 4's answer
it's the same prompt
this is for the last video that just
came out the Esports video
I'll read The Prompt too because some
people just listen to this like a
podcast again I want to messages it was
so crazy this Discord there's so many
more listeners than there is like people
that post I have no idea why there's
like there's like tens of thousands of
people that actually could like read it
you can see it in the service ads nobody
[ __ ] posts all right anyway you're a
highly successful YouTuber advising
Devon National in his next video he will
post to YouTube It's the year 2023 Devin
Nash's next video is about Esports
Esports is failing popular teams like
TSM and CLG are pulling out of
competitive Esports bullet points
several elements that Devin should
include on why Esports failed you have
all the knowledge to fulfill this goal
as this highly successful YouTuber treat
yourself as a master of Esports business
I have no opinions I'm trusting you to
make this completely you must include
all the most convincing arguments on why
Esports will not succeed as an industry
you may ask me any questions you need in
order to make the best video possible
make this bullet point list let me talk
a couple of things through prompts
because I just think this is so
important for every single person you
could you guys can meanwhile look in the
Mastermind events chat for people that
are just listening gbt 3.5 put out a
reasonable answer
um that has some things right gbt4
basically crushed it if all I did was
read up every bullet point that no I I
changed the script and it's very
different but if all I did was read
every bullet point I would have had a
solid video that nobody would have
thought was not a devonash video
um but I want to talk about a couple of
things in this prompt that I I think are
super important for everybody so
um and some of this comes down to just
understanding how open AI works so open
AI is uh sorry sorry a gbt is trained to
assume identities
um there's a thing called a system
protocol which uh which means you can
put it in the position to be you are the
world's most famous salesperson
and or and you could also say something
like you are the world's most famous
sales person David ugly or Jay Abram and
it will actually embody that person and
it also so it knows who Devin Nash is so
I don't have to prompt it and tell it so
so I I I've done separate things and
said do you know who Dev Nash is it goes
yep like it's this it has it right so
um knowing that I I've put this thing in
the position of being an advisor to me
and there's a couple of really important
things that I put in here
um I have no opinions is really
important so it reinforces to the AI
that it has to do the entire job of
telling you the answer
um also you may ask me any questions you
need to in order to make this the best
possible will often cause GPT to return
with okay here are some questions and
then you answer those questions and it
produces an even better output so
allowing it to ask questions is
important you should have done every one
of your prompts
um and
setting objectives for what it has to do
and have an outcome like your objective
is to do this right you must conclude
all convincing arguments as to why this
is a thing will help you prompt and get
way better results
um but one of the the most useful things
that anybody can use here is the idea of
uh system identities this is like a
super important concept you you should
tell it to be you could tell it to be
Warren Buffett and then tell it to be
um like
uh Graham this guy taught him
Abram uh anyway like you could tell it
to be different types of personalities
and compare those against each other you
could even have them like in a room and
say these three famous sales people are
arguing and you are these you are
embodying these three famous sales
people thinking like that will like
start to
you should prompt like for example like
with some of the issues that I've heard
on this call you could say something
like
you are a
um M A advisor and a lawyer who is
trying to create the best term sheet
possible you have all the knowledge to
do this you've been informed by tens of
that that will help
gbt reference
and use this the other thing I want to
talk about real quick because
um
while we're on the subject of AI is
every single person should not
underestimate Bing uh Bing is one of the
most useful tools out there I've talked
about in The Mastermind chat a little
bit but Bing is GPT 3.5 and in some
cases gbt4 but it's connected to the
internet it it is a so
you the the use case I'm I've been
telling people about is for the dark and
darker video that I made I had to
reference a lot of obscure Korean media
and I asked it to go find me
the Korean media around Nexon and iron
mace
and then to produce uh as many realistic
sources for that as possible I also
asked it a couple of days ago to find me
as many realistic sources about
um
streaming Sports on Kik my next video is
should you move to kick streaming
and I also asked it to find me tweets
from specific people talking about Kik
so I I literally circumvented Twitter
search
and it just popped them all up Bing
search is amazing it could help
everybody in here
uh everybody should pay attention to
bang it's nuts it's like it's it's nuts
it's it's nuts that they like there's no
reason to use gbt really I mean like the
language learning model of GPT is is
useful for these kind of things but like
for any kind of like references or
research or anything like that you can
just use Bing
and you uh save conversations and Bing
yet because I was using it for a little
bit and it's kind of annoying you can't
save them but you can it will remember
the current conversation you're in you
can also you can also plugs Bing's API
into other stuff like typingmind.com and
then you can save conversations
okay yeah
I used it for a little bit too and I had
the same conclusion it felt a lot better
I'm a lot more accurate yeah like ask it
questions but and if I don't know what I
want to move we have some really
interesting topics to talk about today
um so I'll try to I'll try not to be an
AI bro for much longer but suffice to
say that like when plugins come that
will be completely different so open AI
was showing us a demo of their plugins a
couple weeks ago and there's a plug-in
for OpenTable where you could just tell
GP to T3 like hey I'm feeling some
Korean food tonight it goes okay here's
like two or three of the best Korean
places in Dallas and then you say great
book me a table at 7 pm and it does the
whole thing closed loop it's insane it
just it just plugs right into open AI uh
sorry open tables API and then it it
does the reservation you're done you're
just you're just [ __ ] done and then
on and then there's zapier where like
you can plug into things like Shopify
and do this so it's like order me the
best pair of walking shoes and it's
closely done it's all done uh plugins
are gonna change everything like we're
at the very beginning
oh man it's so insane it's so crazy man
okay I gotta stop AI brood yeah Logan
what's up
um
okay
um is this the question do you have any
concepts questions to ask that you think
are really important when thinking about
shared humanity and connection
when looking at why people connect with
certain stories people content the study
about exploit is a concept to help
replace looking at analytics oh okay in
process of deciding so this is from the
okay this is a good question
um to help replace looking at analytics
in the process of deciding what things
I'm interested in to explore and for
their hone in the process of further
putting myself in the position to grow
my unique voice I'm asking because I
think learning about it in this way
helps me understand why I connect with
people and ideas
right
um I think I understand what you're
asking what you're asking is really
complex so if I don't answer it
correctly you can
um
correct me
uh this is so for people that don't or
aren't listening to every Mastermind
formerly we had a talk I think last two
weeks ago about
the idea of paying attention to
analytics versus paying attention to
like the stories and reasons that people
create things the latter of which is
like way more important than the
analytics part right so this is sort of
a follow-up to that question as I
understand it what really makes people
connected to things
um
so there are some objective answers to
this there's there's a
some objective principles and and the I
think my one of my favorite things about
marketing
is that you can go through
old
and I mean old old like 1950s
advertisements and see the same things
in advertising that we see today and
they all work just the same
now I'm gonna give you guys something
that I've never talked about before
because it just comes to mind here
and that is
um
a concept by Tony Robbins called the six
human needs I I absolutely love this
concept the poster in events chat but
I'm gonna read it for people listening
so Tony Robbins is a super debatably the
most famous self-improvement person of
all time
um actually I don't know if that's a
debate maybe Jesus but but he's up there
uh and and he came up with this idea
that's called the six human needs which
basically says that there are four
primary needs
um that I have this memorized so I'm
just gonna go over it but like there are
four primary needs that every single
human being needs to fulfill for
themselves in some way and then there's
two kind of like ones that are like
great to have and we'll read through
them right now so certainty so certainty
is the idea that a roof is not going to
fall uh or right now you're sitting in a
chair somewhere maybe you're standing
maybe you're driving you are betting
that the floor won't fall out on it from
under you and you will sink to Earth's
core without certainty you have nothing
so certainty is really important at
least certainly like that the sun is
going to rise again you have reasonable
expectation to to grow but also
certainty is very important in obvious
ways which is like
um
the I like I I could be fairly certain
that like my paycheck is coming next
month or that like my wife is gonna stay
with me right obviously if I don't have
those things stuff gets start to get
really weird but we also have
uncertainty and variety is number two so
uncertainty means like you need to mix
stuff up like it can't be the same every
time I don't want to play the same video
game over and over again I don't want to
be in the same place over and over again
there's a human need to sort of push
people towards the next thing uh what
whatever that is uh then there's
significance so significance means that
you need to feel like you are special
significant important in someone's life
so for some people significance means
just that one person that you're with
that's your wife or husband that you
just feel is like making you feel
validated and significant and that's
enough for other people they want the
whole world right like you know Jeff
Bezos doesn't stop until he is the
richest person on the planet like Elon
doesn't stop until he gets people to
bars like a lot of these people are very
driven by significance connection and
love which is number four is like the
idea of just being close to either a
community or an individual again or it
can to be a concept it could also be
like connection and love to your work
that feeling of just being connected and
fulfilled by something those are your
four primaries generally everybody is
focused on two so everybody has like two
of these six
they really focus on
um and they kind of change throughout
their lives number five is uh these now
we're kind of into this sort of I I say
quotations optional ones but optional is
I'd say these are still like kind of
needed growth which means you kind of
need to be feeling like you are
progressing in a direction this is one
of my primaries out of my two
um growth is a big one for me you have
to really feel like you are progressing
in some way
um whether that be intellectually
whether that be financially
um various different kind of scorecards
arbitrary or not that are set up to make
you feel like you are growing or that
you are um growing with other people
contribution which means a sense of
giving back and a sense of helping
others and the feeling of being in
service to other people those are the
six human needs so to go back to Logan's
question
essentially every this is where this
gets really cool and this is my huge
passion for marketing every single story
every single idea starts from one of
these six
everything everything in humanity
and can fall into this so if you are
making a YouTube channel
um you could pick any one of these
or two of them or three of them and you
could
make a very successful YouTube channel
so like what is someone like Mr Beast
focus on out of these two out of these
right well he focuses on uncertainty and
variety because he's blowing up
Lamborghinis he's doing crazy [ __ ] he's
feeding into that idea of people getting
the next thing over and over again and
he's focused on contribution which is
like he's doing team trees he's doing
team C's he's doing huge philanthropy
he's doing he's like like those two
things are the main focus of why you go
to that YouTube channel to watch and
once you understand again we were
talking a little bit earlier in this
Mastermind about first principles
thinking cutting away as much of the
[ __ ] as possible to really
understand the underlying idea if you
understand what a story is providing out
of these six things you can start to
sort of structure why things might be
valuable to people or not the best
stories in the world include all of
these elements and there's um if you
want to learn more about storytelling
look into a philosopher named Joseph
Campbell who wrote a book called The
Heroes the hero's journey or the or the
or he also has a really good book on
myth I can't remember the exact title of
um but Joseph Campbell inspired by Jung
is a person who essentially brought the
West the idea of the hero's journey
which has now been used in like most of
our good stories like Star Wars
lucasfilms worked directly with Joseph
Campbell to build the original trilogy
um the Lord of the Rings Tolkien was
heavily inspired by Jung
um and the in the essential story goes
like this like you have a single
character who is typically not developed
yet they go out into the world they or
they're they're in a place usually a
place is kind of closed off so Frodo for
example and Lord of the Rings is in this
closed off Shire where like there is no
pain uh Luke Skywalker in episode one is
on the farm he's never really
experienced like very great difficulty
then something happened there's a huge
life-changing event so with um Luke
Skywalker for example the Stormtroopers
come kill us kill his family with Frodo
the bad school will come you'll see all
these similarities it's basically the
same story and and I might and like
warning I might like [ __ ] up your life
because you just gotta start seeing this
in every movie it's like if you you
start seeing this but like
um right so so now
um this uh Capstone event has forced
these people to go out into the world
and develop and now they start growing
they start they they they start what
happens they undergo a mission that is
greater than themselves so for Frodo he
has to Bear the burden of the ring and
for Luke Skywalker he has to Bear the
burden of the rebellion and the Empire
which is crushing people these are great
burdens to bear and Frodo uh meets these
people along the way and these are
called archetypes these are people that
appear in our lives that have
um that will help us through this and
help us achieve these six goals that
Tony Robbins talks about
uh for example the archetype of the
great wizard okay
um in episode one uh technically episode
four of Star Wars is Obi-Wan right the
the kind of guide that brings Luke
Skywalker around and starts to teach him
and later that great wizard role is that
great teacher role is uh inhabited by
Yoda uh with the Frodo that is Gandalf
right this Gandalf is the great
literally the wizard who teaches the
next steps to Frodo and these people
archetypally are not supposed to solve
the story themselves that's why like
Daniel didn't just like take the ring
get on the eagle and like go to the
Mordor and be like well GG guys like
that would have been a very short movie
right would have been a good story
because it wouldn't have it wouldn't
have taken in these six elements where
you see Frodo struggle with uncertainty
struggle with significance the feeling
of like am I significant enough to bear
this Wing there's badass dwarves like
Gimli there's badass elves there's ten
thousand years old like Legolas that
should be doing this why am I doing this
why am I the one to do it going to
connection and love the feeling for Sam
the feeling for his friends the feeling
for the fellowship right same with Luke
Skywalker would go through all these
things
um the feeling of growth the feeling of
contribution giving back is like is that
significant enough and and the the the
the struggle of dealing with certainty
and uncertainty these are the things
that create a compelling Story and
there's I I would go so far to say
Joseph Campbell would say that this is a
rule set there are ways to tell the
story that are different but generally
speaking you get a shitty movie if you
if you use or or a shitty story I should
say if you circumvent these rules and a
good example of that is like the ray
Skywalker Saga which was a series of
movies made that didn't understand the
hero's journey and thus put a character
who never really had the struggle she
was already the strongest Jedi she was
already the strongest person and so that
story felt off to many people
um because these six things were not
being addressed really well actually
every one of them was like awkward and
we could we could go through it I think
I'm probably talking too much about like
a particular thing but the reason why
we're talking about this is to convey
the idea that if you use these six
underlying principles to start
understanding how storytelling is done I
think you can create the best content in
the world
um and I think the best content creators
in the world are following it does need
to be about all six like I I don't even
know if you can the masterpieces like I
don't know if Lord of the Rings the
original Three movies could be made
better they're almost perfect films well
it's it's crazy right because they they
perfectly incorporate this idea of the
hero's journey I also like that's the
same with the Star Wars children too
like I don't know if if episode's um
um if the original Three episodes could
be made better I did it's perfect like
like the story is so good because they
incorporate these six elements but you
uh and usmere Mortals like might just
want to appeal to like one or two things
in our storytelling and by the way this
like applies to like people that aren't
content creators like if you want to
tell stories through sales that's a
story you're telling right and so let's
talk about sales for a second Super
useful this is one of the most I think I
attribute almost all of my ability to
sell to this concept which is like
if I am selling something to somebody
what am I selling them like which of
these six so if I'm selling Novo
Services I'm really selling that company
certainty that their ad campaigns are
gonna crush it and that they're going to
and they they're gonna know that the
money they're spending on marketing is
going to give them a good return and
that they can have certain in that I'm
also selling them significance
okay like I I because their brand is
gonna become more significant they're
gonna they're gonna grow at exposure
they're gonna be talked about and uh and
I'm all but not only am I selling the
company now I'm also selling the
individuals so the individuals they
might be connected by other things and
if you start understanding what
individuals can be motivated by now
we're in a whole different game right
because maybe I'm talking to a person
and she picks up the call and my product
is based on certainty and significance
but what she really wants is connection
and love she really wants to feel like
this business is taking care of her
business and so now it's my job to
identify and translate that product into
that number four so that I can
communicate to her why this product is
right for her because she won't respond
to something like significance or
certainty she'll respond to why we are
the agency that will really care about
what she is actually out to do and that
and we're going to connect with with
that on that level or a person who's
like heavily motivated by um by growth
right or like might like want to
understand how this is going to help
grow their brand and actually grow their
business into something or right like
and like this just again this is like
view this as like the fundamental
primordial ooze every one of you that is
listening to this right now came here
because I provide you one of these six
things that's it and when I don't you
won't be here and that's fine that's how
that's that's how the world works so I
really encourage you to think about this
in your product development and your
storytelling everything you do as to how
you apply these things because these are
literally the building blocks of
humanity yeah I hope that answers your
question
yeah of course
okay so a cool example of how we
implemented storytelling into one of my
friends YouTube channels recently yeah
of course right
um so I was working with my friend for a
while and we he uh he makes like
educational guides for like Valor and
stuff
um and he would always make these videos
and they would get like a small amount
of views because I guess people uh it
feels like you're going to like a
lecture or something you know you like
watch it and it's like it's helpful for
people who are really looking to learn
the game but it doesn't appeal to like a
mass audience of the game um but it's
something that always does is just
storytelling if you can tell a good
story you can get people investedly
really easily
um so I was trying to convince him to
Pivot his content and I'm gonna link two
videos here if that's okay
um in The Mastermind event chat
um so this was like one of the first
ones like the first Style
um and I think that I I think it gets
kind of nerdy if you like watch through
it it's like a cool intro and it's like
really flashy but we converted it into
um this and it just like completely took
off and I think it's really funny too
because like when you first start
experimenting with this you might be
you'll get like that first reaction of
like I I don't think this is it you know
like it doesn't seem like right I'm like
not good at this but it's really like
the difference between the two is just
so jarring
um and like once you actually committed
to it now this is all he does because
obviously it's performed incredibly well
so he just he's putting it on repeat and
stuff but it's crazy how how big of an
impact it did to just switch his
mentality from I'm gonna teach people to
I'm going to tell a good story about
this game
um and teach people in the process a
little bit so what aspects of
Storytelling do you think change to make
this a successful because that's that's
a very big change like this is 600 000
more views
so for me what I um what I told him is
why why is the games that he's breaking
down important like what is it about
them that like makes it stick out
um because he could talk about how so
this video the one that popped off was
um it's about how like a PC utility got
like a lot of value in the game
um but he made it literally just about
that player he didn't do anything but
like you can look on the map and you
could see how impactful this utility is
so it's still the educational still
covering the same topic but he kind of
zero it in on like that turret won the
game
um that one PC utility uh so it's like
the story of like I don't know I guess
the turret in that regard
um
yeah we had a conversation in Mastermind
chat a couple of days ago with Olivia I
think who makes some ASMR content and uh
she showed the difference between her
videos that just had active voice where
they were saying something about like
this is this is directly involving you
the person in the ASMR like like you are
the person being dominated by the ogre
or whatever it's it's pretty much yeah
yeah it was a really useful chat it's
it's a pretty it's Fringe content for
sure I'm here for it but like
um that single active voice
changed completely like like it was like
10x the views yeah there's um so I I
Feel Like Making and again like like
what have you done in the storytelling
elements kind of keep on the same theme
like well you've identified a character
which is the turret in this case right
and and it's sort of its own heroic
journey to try to accomplish something
it gets that's it's that simple right
like once you start basing things on
these sort of um these sort of six
principles
um you can make even something that like
and there's a this is a concept in
humanity called the
anthropomorphotizing I think I've got
that right which is the idea of like you
know making something human like we are
we attached these stories like Wally
it's like a perfect example another one
that um uses a lot of elements Pixar
commonly and Disney commonly used
elements of the hero's journey we have
this little robot that's kind of like
wandering through um this like Wasteland
but you start to really feel things for
this robot
um because it has its own struggles and
story and it has its own needs that it's
trying to fulfill right and you can
actually point to what Wally needs you
can point to what what what
um on the six that it wants and what
it's doing and we identify with that
because we're trying to we're on that
same Journey so if you learn about that
from a storytelling perspective it can
it can really help you uh build
interesting things and also another
really quick thing on this it also kind
of helps you forward Society in a way
because through these stories we better
understand ourselves so when you tell a
truly good story one of the directors
that I absolutely love for this and I
think is one of the best directors in
Hollywood period is Christopher Nolan uh
who will oftentimes focus on a concept
like fear or a concept like bravery or
something like that and uh we'll make a
whole kind of video about a whole movie
about it
and through that helps people better
understand themselves and that really
should be your goal with any kind of
content you create even if you think
you're just doing some dumb stuff with
like gaming or whatever like like you
can still help there's tons of gaming
channels that have changed my life um a
really notable one is like John Baines
chat right TotalBiscuit who would make
videos that I think really changed the
game of like um news journalism and
still there's a lot of things inspired
by him today that even after he passed
away from cancer some time ago
um
and that's a good example of like like
you should Endeavor in your content to
try to create something that makes
people better understand themselves in
relation to these stories
so I'm trying to think of like humor
related content right is is that
certainty right certainty that you're
going to gain pleasure from that
type of content I'm trying to figure out
how like what and what I guess I mean
reframe the all comedy relies on
uncertainty variety all of it um that it
is it is the primary driver of comedic
pulse so if you understand
comedy is something that I I think that
people think you can't learn this I
think that top comics would say that you
can
um uncertainty and variety if you look
at like the
way that
comedians are delivering their material
now
all of it is based on the audience not
really knowing the next turn
to the point of like the top like who
are the top communities in the world
it's like Dave Chappelle Kevin Hart I
think is number one
but and there's a bunch of other ones
that Tom cigarettes going up there like
all these guys if you like listen to and
I encourage you like if you're in comedy
like you should be spending a huge
amount of your time
on watching every Netflix schedule like
getting your hands on everything you can
so it's over in that material and even
like really pacing things like rules of
threes and stuff like that are really
important
um comedy is is exclusively fulfilling
the need of uncertainty that people
won't know where it goes next yeah
hey Devin I had a question about uh
crowdfunding and what I can personally
be doing uh during my campaign I know
that obviously maybe I would change my
strategy moving forward
um to prepare for a net campaign
um but like when I'm in the campaign
right now all I'm really doing is like I
got my socials I got my Outreach I'm
trying to do some sort of a little bit
of exposure on both streams and like
other podcasts but what do you think is
the highest value like return for like
my time because right now I'm kind of
just doing like
30 to 60 emails a day to retailers
that's got me some return and we'll see
if that pans out by the end of the
campaign I suspect many of them may end
up picking it up at the end of The
Campaign but um
yeah what do you think that's probably
the most useful
use of your time like
I've hard-pressed
to recommend to anyone that's just
sitting down every day and sending
outbound emails it's like hard to find
something better for most people than
that it is it is that is probably the
most the most useful way to use my time
like straight up right right like like
from a pure return like sending out
emails
throwing my throwing throwing my thing
myself in the ring is probably it
um
the way to think about your campaign
is all distribution for people that are
um that need context on this this is
Friday she's running a campaign that is
about
a dungeon this is my connection with it
is a Dungeons and Dragons um Undead evil
villains um like uh kind of like Source
module which is like actually super cool
because I do think Dungeons and Dragons
needs more of that and
um
she started Kickstarter she's got a lot
of good people on it and this
Kickstarter is Raising
um to distribute that book and and that
source and that model
uh and it's going well she she's happy
and stuff doubts but I think it's going
well for whatever that's worth so
um the question is really like like if
you're in the middle of one of these
campaigns like what are you doing with
your time and I think it's two things I
really do think it's like hard outbound
um and you're doing that successfully
but I also think it's like
you're on a time frame but you have to
really think about distribution channels
because
um
what can get me
first of all who's who are my customers
and and like like in the cases like
who's gonna be funding this thing is it
mostly retailers or is it like actual
individuals that be interested in it is
it both like what percentage and then
once you figure that out you got to
figure out like what the best way to
reach out to those people is so my focus
right now first of all keep everything
you're doing and outbound that's like
I'm never gonna tell you not to do
outbound that's super good but with
whatever other time you have
you're going to want to be thinking
about distribution channels like Reddit
like if rdnd is like a massive place if
you can get on there somehow and and
work with those moderators or something
that's like a huge deal yeah
we were we were on the front page of our
DND the first day of the campaign but it
didn't net us any real uh we got like a
thousand upvotes
um but we didn't get any really I don't
based on the traffic Source it wasn't us
that posted us it was somebody else but
based on the traffic sources we didn't
get a ton of sales off of it we got a
few I think but um I guess exposure is
good but uh and maybe some of those
people followed and maybe they'll apply
later but
um so yeah we have been on Reddit uh we
we are going to be featured in um we've
already been in Gizmodo io9 we're um
we're in gonna be in polygon here pretty
soon we'll have a whole feature about us
um but yeah I I just don't know what
else to do so I've like I'm like uh I
guess I'm just second guessing myself
because I'm like I already feel like I'm
doing a lot but like what if I'm doing
the wrong thing that's it well no your
first principles are right so so number
one it's like reaching out to retailers
and and doing outbound the the second
thing is you're doing
um distribution channels so your
distribution channel is Reddit
um Gizmodo these are good the only thing
that could be that you could you could
sort of face check is your storytelling
um if if it hit Rd and D Rd is enough to
like fund a campaign day one so if it
hit that and it didn't resonate as well
as you expected then something's wrong
with your storytelling I don't know what
because I I'm not deep enough in the
sauce but that's the issue yeah because
okay yeah because because you're you're
in front of enough people that could
solve your problem you're not solving it
because your storytelling is is
something somebody's lucky
yeah that makes sense I uh I've been
reworking my coffee on the kickstarter
campaign because I did have that fear
and I have tightened it up and made it
more focused and a better story just on
the campaign page because at first I
guess it wasn't really clear for a lot
of people like what does this book do
which is like a huge blunder on my part
but I I kind of showed that up and made
it a little more clear but it's like
it's queer Gothic horror and it's like
meant to be played in a safe environment
for um for like women and and other
people so it and it's also meant to be
like really like cool and like provide
you a lot of uh tools for a GM to be
able to run that even if you're a
beginner so I changed that about our
copy and like got some more help in that
respect but yeah I think you're
absolutely right my Kickstarter page at
first when I launched it was not the
best it could have been so yeah copy is
is going to be the primary driver in a
Kickstarter campaign of like getting
people success right and a lot of things
too is like you have to consider what
your demographic wants so I like
um
dinos and dragons in particular is a
community that
um you could really sell on like better
World building and Source building I
think that's like well it's a collateral
is that the name of critical rules World
um like uh why their campaign is doing
so well for for their products
Alexandria but what's what's the
challenge real isn't that the one of
their Source books oh yeah that's um
yeah tell Dory is
so that was the first book that I paid
attention to yeah that's our book yeah
and the raise and then the raising from
it so I think the storytelling around
that was really good and there's a lot
of lessons to learn there because they
were able to tell the story of like this
is your guide to building an entire
world here almost so similar to why like
stuff like ravenloft and like dark sun
does so well because they really
provided an all-in solution
um to that problem which which your your
product actually should do it it it it
to me it provides an all-in solution to
the issue of of like truly evil villains
um but I don't know if your your copy
can conveys that uh and so and so that's
something to look at yeah
yeah absolutely actually it's funny you
say that um I explained that in the copy
now that we're A Book Like Explorer's
guide to Wild Mount or tall Dory reborn
and that you use it in that similar way
so yeah
yeah yeah that it can be a complete
solution to that so sometimes
um
there are like alternative things that
uh like alternative selling points that
maybe you feel you need to include to
um to sell but in reality you just have
to kind of solve that one problem
um and convey to people that it that
that you do that also
um your video assets uh might also have
to address those issues too so like
because the video asset is just as
important as your written copy in
Kickstarter yeah yeah
um yeah actually what happened with the
video asset is I had some vo people
lined up but they just didn't deliver on
time so I was like [ __ ] I gotta put
together a video last minute yeah
there's gonna be a lot of things that
happen like that I mean like I'm just
telling you like sort of objectively
like what I I I think the direction is
yeah yeah absolutely yeah uh I
definitely so I [ __ ] up because I
didn't have that [ __ ] done like two
months prior to the campaign so yeah
that's definitely my fault yeah it's
hard kickstarter's hard yeah yeah yeah
it's super difficult all good I mean for
what it's worth I think you're doing
exceptionally well I mean I I know
you're objectively doing exceptionally
well because
um not many kickstarters accomplish what
you already have accomplished
yeah thank you so much Devin thanks for
answering the question that's really
helpful good yeah yeah of course
all right what else we got
anything else for this week
okay well we talked about the
hero's journey six human needs that can
help a lot of people
um
being AI a lot of good stuff there I
think this is like a really good one
actually I'm feeling it
um yeah I'd probably talk for longer but
like I said
um just going through a lot of stuff at
Esports right now I'm actually probably
gonna have to fly down to LA
um but I I I don't think that should
interrupt her
could be doing that for like a few days
I I don't think it should interrupt
anything
we should still
be on track for these Saturdays so
expect the next one like again I'm
trying really hard not to miss these I
think they're really useful to a lot of
people and I appreciate everybody that
wants to come and and bring something it
feels like we have a good direction for
these like every time so yeah thank you
everybody for taking the time I'll
upload this within the next couple of
days
um the next thing on the patreon I think
for next week we'll be going over email
templates and direct outbound I've
actually been scripting that for a while
because I'm actually like going through
and providing like a bunch of old
templates that I found from a um for and
like how I think the outbound is
improved
so I'm just trying to get that video
right it might take a while
um but it will get done and then
um we're gonna do a video on Kick
streaming on the YouTube
and and that's really just going to be a
um
you know that that Meme where like you
pull off the like Scooby-Doo meme where
they pull off the ghost so there's
something else like you you pull off the
sheet and it's really a video about
multi-streaming but in the context of
kick so that's what I'm doing okay
um thank you everybody I've been also
real quick a note on the Mastermind chat
uh it has been so cool to be seen oh
yeah what's up Logan what do you got uh
oh just really briefly um and learning
about a hero's journey and like how to
tie these six different things together
um what would be like a good resource
you'd recommend to like really immerse
myself Campbell man
um start with a book so Jung is too
comprehensive
um
reading the Jung I so I did this um it's
one of my Majors
um I would read Joseph Campbell and the
book I'd specifically read or listen to
because he has an audio program that's I
think like six episodes is the power of
myth
right again like like the not like the
early early 90s or late 80s or something
the power of myth Joseph Campbell will
get you started there's a lot of stuff
on Jung so Jung and the collected
archetypes but I I just I honestly
wouldn't recommend it like reading you
is insane like you get through like a
page a day and you're like oh my God
it's really hard so Joseph Campbell is
the power of myth is where I'd start uh
really learning about like the sort of
core building blocks
um
of like what make these stories for sure
yeah okay thank you so much Young by the
way uh
j-u-n-g uh but Joseph Campbell is just
um uh j-o-s-e-f
-h-c-a-m-p Bell that's it
yeah okay all right uh young down for
like a couple years from now yeah yeah
Jung's one of those people like if you
get really into this the stuff like then
Campbell will take you naturally in that
direction because that's that's really
his mentor
um but yoga is something that I think
just for most people is just too
esoteric to like kind of apply it kind
of has to be translated through other
sources well a lot of those philosophers
are like that like like
um some of them are a little bit more
accessible like Niche and stuff like
that but if you're looking to like read
like Kant or Jung or something like that
or Hegel you're just like oh my God I I
just strap in I'm gonna read like a page
every week it is gonna [ __ ] with me
every time so
um thank you everybody and then like I
also want to say on The Mastermind chat
I've been uh super pumped about seeing
people's success stories some of the
people like pursue that are like uh
who's in here actually
um or like Shiro they're like giving us
updates on things a Link's been doing
that too so a huge awesome like seeing
people's like posting their W's is
Friday Also with the um Kickstarter
campaign I just like love seeing that
and it's sparking a lot of interesting
conversations so thank you guys for
bringing that channel live it seems like
it's um like the the program that we're
doing here is like light years past
where it was six months ago that is
super neat
all right I'll see you guys again next
week take care okay thanks everybody
